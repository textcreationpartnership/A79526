            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All that cometh is vanity.</hi> And the laſt argument which he uſeth, is from the ending and concluding of all theſe things; there is a certain night of evil and ſorrow which wil follow the brighteſt day which we do or can enjoy in the world; if no troubles come with it, yet there is enough comes after it to blaſt it in our thoughts. From hence he proceeds to Application, and it is to Young-men, Ch. 11.9. <hi>Rejoyce O young man in thy youth, and let thine heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eys:</hi> This is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with, but a confuting of the vain fooliſh reſolutions of youth; by this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides their thoughts, and withall gives them a preſervative or antidote againſt ſuch madneſs. <hi>Know thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgement.</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170260:5"/>been mindful of that Country from whence they came out, <hi>i.e.</hi> if they had deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, they might have had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.7. <hi>When my ſoul fainted in me, I remembred the Lord.</hi> This is ſuch a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, ſays <hi>Junius,</hi> as doth not onely bring God to our thoughts, but carries the whole ſoul with the greateſt intention to mind him, with the neglect or contempt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things. So it is uſed to expreſſe the greateſt affection and favour of ſpirit that may be found amongſt Gods people, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We will remember thy Loves, more then Wine,</hi> (i.e.) we wil take pleaſure in thy loves, and embrace the thoughts of it above all things. So that to remember God, is to do that which we ought to do, when we remember we ſhould deſire him, exerciſe our thoughts and meditations ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and delight our ſelves highly in it. Nay remembring doth not include on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the inward acts of the ſoul, the motion of the Will and Affections to ſuch an object now preſented to the Underſtanding; but it takes in the outward acts too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the outward behaviour of a man is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thoſe impreſſions which are within. Thus <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> his rage againſt <hi>Vaſti,</hi> is expreſſed by this phraſe, <hi>Heſter</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>He remembred Vaſti, (i, e.)</hi> he talked of her unkindneſs and rebellion, and reſolved to be revenged of her. Thus the wickedneſs of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and her whoredom in her old age is expreſt, by a remembring of the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of her youth, <hi>Ez.</hi> 23.19. Then perſons are ſaid to remember any thing when they expreſs the ſame in their actions, and do that which ſpeaks out the thoughts of their hearts; ſo that to remember God, is to do that which becomes a people to do, who do remember God; to have God in our mouths, and God in our lives, this is properly a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of God; ſo that the exhortation here is very ful and large, and may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either to be,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the ſame extent with that concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and a diſcovery of the fear of the Lord, wherein it doth conſiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſtant eying of God. Or</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Text is one Branch of the means preſcribed to attain the fear of the Lord: which is a ſetting the Lord before us; the other Branch he handles before; <hi>(viz.)</hi> the conſidering of the vanity of the world, and all things in it; and upon theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of the vanity of the Creature, and the excellency of the Creator, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades to the fear of the Lord; and he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them both in order to that concluſion,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170260:6"/>verſ. 13. <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> intimating, That the neglect of <hi>God,</hi> and of his ways, did ariſe from a miſtake of the world, and from a forgetfulneſs of God; therefore, <hi>Remember thy (Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Why doth he cloſe this title for the Lord, and to preſent him thus to our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Firſt negatively, not becauſe this is the moſt excellent Title or Name of God; for God hath other Names and Titles more glorious then this, although this be full of glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Nor that he would bound the thoughts and ſpirit of man within this knowledge of God, but would allow him to travel farther then the work of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as into the works of Providence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the works of Redemption, wherein God hath as it were laid the Top-ſtone of his glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He chuſeth this conſideration of God, as being moſt ſuitable to the ſubject of his Diſcourſe; he had been diſcourſing of the vanity of creatures, and beating men off from them, and in oppoſition to them nothing more ſuitable to be ſet up then the Creator, that they might not fal into that horrid wickedneſs too common in mens

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He mentions this name of <hi>God</hi> more then any other, becauſe from hence did follow an univerſal argument, which reached all ſorts of people; this was a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all ſtood in towards God; he might not have argued from providence ſo wel; for then it would not have been ſo ſtrong to the poor as to the rich; nor from Redemption; for then the unconverted, or the doubting Soul could not have made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual uſe of it with thoſe who ſaw their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and knew it in him through Chriſt; but as a <hi>Creator</hi> he ſtands related to all, good and evil, rich and poor, high and low, yong and old, <hi>Jew and Gentile;</hi> ſo that he that had leaſt from God, had his being, and <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>Creator</hi> challenged reſpect and ſervice from him; and if he had no more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, yet herein he was to <hi>remember</hi> God; and if more, then not onely as a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> but in all his glory; as verſe the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Thus the duty; Now the Adjunct of time.</p>

Now ſaith the Wiſe-man, that thou art come to thy riper years, and art weighing things in this ballance in order to thy ſetling and fixing thy ſpirit upon that which ſhal appear moſt conſiderable, now <hi>Remember thy Creatour,</hi> put him in one ſcale againſt all them, and let reaſon and Judgement determine whether he be not to be choſen before all things; ſee whether his excellency will not weigh down all theſe vanities, but do it in the day that thou art chuſing, and when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and judgement are quickeſt, and leaſt engaged, leaſt the engaging of theſe blinde thee, that thou wilt not ſee the ſcale when it turns. We have a Scripture which will give much light to this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25. Moſes <hi>when he came (to years) refuſed to be called the ſon of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Daughter, and choſe rather to ſuffer with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon;</hi> when he came to weigh and conſider things, and to make his choice, then <hi>he refuſed to be called the ſon of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Daughter,</hi> then he threw away the Court Honours and Pleaſures but it was in judgement, <hi>he choſe rather to ſuffer with the people of God;</hi> he ſaw ſomething of greater importance to him. Before this time he was pleaſed wel enough with AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian toys and trifles of the Court, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170260:9"/>now comes his chuſing time, he muſt be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſpirit, and he weighs all, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſerious ſurvey of both ſides, he throws away the Rattles which hee had played withall before, and he makes another choice; <hi>he choſe rather to ſuffer.</hi> Thus wee have the ſum of the words, <hi>in the dayes of thy choice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is a ſecond word to make it more full. In thy choice dayes, in the days that thou art fitteſt for Meditation or Action, then ſet the Lord before thee; do not put off the thoughts of God till a time when thou ſhalt be altogether unfit for him, and his Service, till a time wherein thou wilt be fit for nothing; theſe are the choice days, and thy <hi>youth</hi> is the chuſing time. We have the ſame word, which in my text is rendered <hi>youth,</hi> read <hi>choſen men,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.1. David <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together the choſen men of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the choiſeſt and fitteſt men for action;</hi> now thou art fitteſt for the Service of the Lord; and this ſenſe ſeemes to correſpond much with the text; for it agrees much with that which is but a Paraphraſe upon theſe words, <hi>before the evil dayes come, when thou ſhalt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them;</hi> Do not ſay in thy heart, I will try what the world will afford me now, and when I have ſucked the breaſts of her conſolation dry, and there
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170260:9"/>no more to be had there, then <hi>I</hi> will try what is to be had in Religion, what the ways of <hi>God</hi> will yeeld; this Religion is a thing only fit for old Men and Women that have nothing elſe to do, whoſe palats are grown old, and cannot relliſh or taſte the delights which youth affords, or whoſe memories are grown weak, and have forgotten the pleaſures of their paſt days; theſe may begin to think of Heaven now their blood is grown cold, and their ſenſes fail them, that they can hardly diſtinguiſh between ſweet and bitter; when we have worn out our ſelves in the world, and crippled our Bodies, and worn out our Senſes in turning every ſtone, and ſucking every flower which will afford us any comfort, then will we creep to our Cloſets and cloyſter up our ſelves there too, and ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of our dayes in praying and ſighing; but for our youth, you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us; we will take this time to our ſelves to eat, drink, and be merry, and put death and Judgement, and every troubleſome thought from us.

If thou doſt refuſe them, can they revenge thy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them at that rate which the Lord can? Can they deal with their deſpiſers as the Lord doth with his? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be turned into hell, and all the Nations that forget God;</hi> Or can they reward their ſervants as God doth his? Have they the Keys of the grave, and Heaven, and Hell at their girdles? Have they a power ſuitable unto his?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider how infinitely the Lord is above all thy ſervices; not taking this into conſideration breeds ſo many put offs; men think any thing good enough for God, the very dreggs of their time and ſtrength, the weak and the lame wil ſerve him, and a little of that too; but didſt thou conſider the vaſt diſproportion that is betwixt God and thee, thou wouldeſt not think all thy time too much, nor the choiceſt of it too good for him who is infinitely above all that thou canſt offer up unto him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16.2.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170260:12"/>
                     <hi>My goodneſs extendeth not to thee;</hi> whatever thou giveſt him, thou canſt not inrich him, thou canſt not adde unto him; nay, when thou haſt given him all, thou haſt given him nothing worthy of him; thou haſt very little reaſon to boaſt, but rather to wonder that the Lord will give thee leave (ſuch a poor wretch) to take his Name into thy mouth. If this conſideration were kept in all duties and addreſſes unto God, it would make us more frequent in duties, and more ſerious; it would check thoſe vain thoughts of men, who think the laſt hour ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and the ſhorteſt hour long enough, and the ſlighteſt ſervice good enough for the great and infinite God, who ſhall one day deſpiſe their image, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.20. <hi>As dream when one awaketh, ſo, O Lord, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> thou awakeſt thou ſhalt deſpiſe their Image.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider how the Lord ſtands upon points of Honour; his Name is very precious, and he wil exalt it either in your ſouls, or upon them; although you may think it a ſlight thing, and what injury or wrong is it to him if I go on a little longer, and enjoy this luſt or that? the Lord hath made ſuch proffers to thy foul in Chriſt, that the world cannot parallel, and he ſtands upon point of Honour in this caſe; Moſt he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170260:13"/>wait and be put off? and every baſe Luſt, and every lying vanity entertained, and his Service laid aſide? May not <hi>I</hi> ſay as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to <hi>Ahaz,</hi> Iſa. 7.13. <hi>Is it a ſmall thing to weary men, but you muſt weary my God alſo?</hi> A man will not indure this that has any ſpirit of a man in him, that has reſpect to Honour, he will not put it up to be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and ſo his inferiors accepted upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy terms, when he is put off, who offered terms more honourable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious? the Lord calls this a double evil, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>Hath a Nation chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their gods, which yet are no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. Be aſtoniſhed O ye heavens at this, and be horribly affraid, be ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>For my people have committed two evils, they have forſaken me the Fountain of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters, and hewed them out Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns that will hold no water.</hi> It was one evil, and very diſhonourable to God, that his people did forſake him; it was a blemiſh which the Heathen did not caſt upon their gods; but it was a double diſhonour to God that they went off upon bad and baſe terms. Remember all you that are invited daily to come to Chriſt, and yet come not, notwithſtanding thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170260:13"/>proffers which he makes to ſouls; and you that pretend to come, but come not in good earneſt, your hearts are going another way; O ſee that you go off upon good terms. God wil one day make you know to what loſſe you go off when you leave him, and how much he takes notice of the diſhonour you caſt upon him, by going off to things ſo infinitely beneath him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider the Mercy of God in Chriſt; this is the great Argument to draw the Soul unto God; theſe are the cords of a man, the winning argument to prevail with an ingenuous ſpirit; I am ſure they are ſtrong arguments to Saints, if not to men; <hi>Paul</hi> knew the weight and ſtrength of this kinde of arguing, when he ventered ſo much duty upon it as the giving up all to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4. <hi>I beſeech you brethren by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, that you preſent your bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that I might help this conſideration to its full weight and value, I ſhall divide it into two parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Conſider External and Temporal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; theſe are Motives; What is there that thou doſt enjoy but it is Mercy to thee? and the leaſt of all theſe hath a voice if thou couldeſt underſtand it, and it importunes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170260:14"/>thee to look up to him from whence is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good gift, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. <hi>Nevertheleſſe hee left not himſelf without witneſſe, in that hee did good, and gave us rain from Heaven and fruitfull ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſſe:</hi> They bear witneſſe that God is merciful, although <hi>I</hi> do not think with ſome, that they bear witneſſe of Chriſt, and of ſpecial pardoning mercy by him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, God hath more mercy, that he might have more fear; he hath Spiritual mercies for your ſouls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>There is mercy with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> It is impoſſible that the true fear of the Lord ſhould bee planted and advanced in the heart without this conſideration; this mercy is pardoning mercy, it is Soul mercy; other conſiderations with this are uſefull to ballance the Spirit; but this is principally attractive; this is the very door of the fear of the Lord; where this is ſhut, there is no way unto repentance. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.25. <hi>But thou ſaidest there is no hope, for I have loved ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and after them I will go.</hi> And Chap. 18.12. <hi>And they ſaid there is no hope, but wee will walke after our own devices, and wee will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.</hi> If God had no mercy for men, it would be vain to perſwade them to fear;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170260:14"/>if men had not ſome kind of hope, they would be helliſhly wicked.</p>
                  <p>And that <hi>I</hi> might yet advance this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in your Souls, take theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is willing to be reconciled to thee although he can deſtroy thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Now then we are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt, that you be reconciled to God;</hi> he hath ways enough to make thee ſtoop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wooing of thee, and can daſh thee in pieces when he pleaſeth; yet he beſeecheth thee, he intreats thee though hee hath no need of thee, but thou haſt need of him; what need hath <hi>God</hi> of thee more then of the Heathens, or Indians, or Turks, who know him not? he could as eaſily have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them as thee; at this day he invites thee, though thou art as the damned (thy nature is as corrupt as theirs, and thy ſins as great as others) before they were caſt in there, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>There is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> O what impreſſion ſhould theſe have upon thy ſoul, if thou wouldeſt give them their full allowance upon thy ſoul in meditation!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He moves them to fear him by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; he might require it by his power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170260:15"/>mercy; hee might have called for as much duty, and have given no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all unto it; but beloved, what heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſnaring language doth he ſpeak, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts, and let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> The Lord might have choſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner of Stile then this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 He offers thee better termes then thou art like to meet withall elſe-where; the world cannot bid ſo faire, nor perform ſo faithfully as he doth. See that Promiſe which the Lord makes to the returning ſinner, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come yee to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea come buy wine and milk without price</hi> verſ. 2. <hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread, and your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for that which ſatisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat yee that which is good, and let your ſoul delight in fatneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Search and finde where the Devil, the World and Sin promiſeth, and when and to whom he gives ſuch a thing as is held out attainable in following God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 If thou haſt taſted of mercy, thou canſt not but acknowledg that it is an engaging thing, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11.12. <hi>For the grace of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170260:15"/>God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared unto all men, teaching us that denying all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. If thou pretendeſt to Saintſhip, and are not drawn by mercy, ſurely thou haſt a frame of ſpirit much different from the Saints of old; <hi>for the love of God conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.4. they had beſeeching ſpirits, which were very much affected with ſuch arguments, as I ſhewed you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If theſe are not perſwaſive motives, how then art thou under that promiſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Afterward ſhall the children of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>return, and ſeek the Lord their God, and</hi> David <hi>their King, and ſhall feare the Lord and his goodneſſe in the latter dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Is it not reaſon that thou ſhouldeſt do Gods work, when he hath provided one to do thine? he hath ſent a Chriſt unto thee, who offers himſelf to be thy life, and thy ſtrength; and he tells thee, That he hath left Heaven for a time, that he might come down, and make ſuch an offer of himſelf to ſinners; and wilt thou not leave a little of the world to offer up thy ſelf to him? Shall the kind proffers of Chriſt in the Goſpel
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170260:16"/>meet with no returns? Canſt thou do leſſe then offer up all that thou haſt, or art, as a reaſonable ſacrifice to him, who ſo freely offers thee himſelf in his Son to be thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, wiſdom, ſanctification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? In a word, to be all and in all to thy ſoul. Canſt thou deny him thy time, who offers thee Eternity? Is thy preſent time, and condition, and ability too good to give out to him who offers thee more in Chriſt then thy preſent condition is able to bear, more then can enter into thine heart to conceive? Reſerve nothing from him of thy little, who gives thee with a reſerve for this reaſon, becauſe thy preſent condition is not capable of all he intends thee.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Conſider how quick the Lord is with ſome men to cut them off without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them many warnings, or ſuffering them to grow up to ſuch a meaſure of ſin as he does others, as he did <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu;</hi> And that Gods coming to Judgement will appear quick when ever it comes. 1. Though thou mayeſt have a ſmooth time in ſin, yet when that time of pleaſure in ſin is paſt, it will ſeem very ſhort. Ask the old man, and he wil tel that his Youth was quickly gone, and Age came ſuddenly upon him; Is not the life paſt like a tale that is told? If God ſhould ſuffer thee to live a full age, and then
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170260:16"/>cut thee off in thy ſin, wouldeſt not thou ſeem to go down quickly into hell?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you compare the time paſt with Eternity; <hi>God is not ſlack concerning his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; you will finde him quick enough when he comes. <hi>Art thou come,</hi> ſay the ſpirits, <hi>to torment us before the time?</hi> as ſome ſay, before the end of the World, and I exclude not that; but how did the Divel know the end was not yet? But it intimates that although the Divel had ſo many thouſand years to tempt, yet he thought it too ſoon to be troubled.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 He may be quick in that he wil be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome; and unwelcom gueſts, when ever they come, wil come too ſoon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 When he cometh lateſt, he will come before thou lookeſt for him; he will come unawares, and ſo wil be quick with thy ſoul; notwithſtanding all this patience, the evil ſervant ſaid not I have no Maſter, nor that his Maſter wil not come, but he delayeth his coming, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24 48, 49. this was the cauſe of his ungodlineſs. But what ſaith Chriſt? <hi>The Maſter of that Servant ſhal come in an hour when he looketh not for him;</hi> theſe ſuppoſed delays on Gods part, breed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays and neglects on our part, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.5. while the Bride-groom ſlept, the good ſlept as wel as the bad; it is a conſideration for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170260:17"/>Saints, as well as for ſinners, to quicken up their ſpirits, and to ſtir them up to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious minding of God. The Apoſtle layeth down a very good preſervative againſt this, <hi>James</hi> 5.9. <hi>Grudge not one againſt another brethren; behold the judge ſtandeth before the door;</hi> at the door of your houſes, at your Shop doors, at every Tavern door, and Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, as thou paſſeſt in at thy Chamber door, at the door of every day, and night, and providence, and he is ready to come and call thee to account without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Not ſome Officers or Fore-runners, but he himſelf is comming without notice, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation and godlineſſe, looking for, and haſtning unto the comming of the day of God?</hi> the ſetting this day near us, is a quickning conſideration to rouſe up the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Conſider the patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of the Lord; and if thou doſt rightly weigh them, they will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Motives to this great work of the fear of the Lord. The wiſe man doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it as an evidence of a wicked heart to take advantage to himſelf from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of the Lord <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170260:17"/>executed ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the Sons of men is fully ſet in them to evil;</hi> and the Apoſtle argueth it at leaſt an argument of an ignorant, if not a ſtubborn ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance and long ſuffering not knowing the goodneſſe of God leadeth thee to repentance?</hi> He draws out this Dilemma with which he galls every one that refuſeth to return under mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and patience; either thou deſpiſeſt the goodneſſe, thou haſt a God-deſpiſing heart where ever thou art; or at laſt if we put a fairer gloſs on it, and the beſt which it will bear, thou haſt an ignorant heart, which doth not underſtand the natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of every diſpenſation of God, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially this under which thou art, this of patience and forbearance. Here is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration which reaches every ſoule this day before me. And therefore lay it home; you are all under the patience of God, at leaſt now.</p>
                  <p>If this conſideration do not quicken up to duty, pray read impartially the frames of your ſpirits in thoſe words laſt read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: And to help this Conſideration for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, pray think in your ſelves what a baſe unworthy thing it is to make the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> to wait upon ſuch a vile
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170260:18"/>wretch as thou art, that he muſt follow thee at thy heels like a Drudge while thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt thy pleaſures, and walkeſt in waies which he abominates. Chriſt uſed it as a mighty Argument to the Spouſe, that he had waited upon her all night, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>My undefiled for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night:</hi> It was too long for him to wait a night; but how many nights and dayes hath the Lord wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on ſome of you? How haſt thou ſuffered him to follow thee from Alehouſe to Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and from Tavern to Tavern, and there he hath checkt thee; and from thence to thy Bed, and from thence to the Tavern again, and from thence into thy Imployment, and from thence to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and hath there convicted thee? and yet thou thinkeſt it nothing to make the Lord wait as a Drudge at thy heels to this very day; is not this very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy dealing with the great God? Nay conſider what will be the end of all this; this patience and forbearance of God will coſt thee deer which thou doſt abuſe; it will be ſaid when God upon account wil charge thee with ſo many dayes Attandance, ſo long <hi>I</hi> waited upon thee in Providences, and ſo long in ordinances, and you made a Drudge of me, made me to follow
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170260:18"/>you from one Alehouſe to another, and from one Tavern to another, and here I checkt you, and in your Chamber, and upon your ſick-beds, but all this attendance was ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>How wilt thou come off? Doſt thou think not to account for this? wil it not be a heavy account, when all the patience and forbearance of God will come in againſt thee? then you ſhall underſtand that ſaying common amongſt us, but little conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and leſs applyed, <hi>Laeſa patientia in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorem vertitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eightly conſider, Although patient, yet he is juſt; and although he ſeem ſlow, yet he is ſure; and without peradvanture he will call thee to an account one day for all thy wayes and works whether good or evil. The neceſſity and uſe of ſuch a conſideration as this we finde, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5.10.11. <hi>For me muſt all appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we perſwade men.</hi> He propounds this as an engaging Motive to the Saints, to ſeek for, and to keep a clear ſight of their intereſt in God, or to ſuch a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him as may be acceptable to him through Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:170260:19"/>
                  <p>And in the ſecond place he lays it down as a preſſing conſideration to thoſe who are acquainted with the Lord, and with his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, to mind other men with theſe things, and to uſe all means by perſwaſive ways to draw them out of the ſnares of the Divel; and from this argument he preſſeth to a ſpeedy repentance. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30, 31. <hi>And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> Verſ. 31. <hi>Becauſe he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the World in righteouſneſſe, by that man whom he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi> I wiſh that this conſideration might come as near to you, as it did to <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix, Acts</hi> 24, 25. <hi>And as he reaſoned of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, Temperance, and Judgement to come,</hi> Felix <hi>trembled;</hi> only thus, that it may have better ſucceſſe, that it may not be ſo ſoon ſhaken off from you as from him. I am ſure it is ſuch a conſideration that if it were wel and ſeriouſly weighed, it would be a great help to ballance thy ſpirit when moſt vain. This we may ſee by the uſe that the wiſe man makes of it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Rejoice O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the daies of thy youth, and walk in the waies of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes, but know thou that for all theſe things God will bring
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170260:19"/>thee to judgement.</hi> He propounds it to him that was reſolved to have no other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours but his own eyes and heart, to the young man in the midſt of his madneſſe; intimating, that if there were any thing that would prove a remora to his ſpirit, when he was under full ſails of vanity, this was like to do it. If any Cable was ſtrong enough to hold the ſhip in theſe rough Seas, it was this, <hi>Remember thou ſhalt come to judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Conſider the Lord in judging ſhall not only judge men for ſins of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but ſins of omiſſion alſo; and this ſhall condemn men before the Lord in the great day. We find the ſervant condemned for not improving his Talent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.25, 26, and 41, 42. verſes. We have the Judgement of the great day paſſing upon this Indictment; not that ſins of commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be left out; but firſt, either to ſhew that if men did but truly meaſure themſelves by omiſſions, there was enough to condemn them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Or becauſe it was not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned among the Jews but ſins of commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be charged, and therefore Chriſt is ſilent in that point.</p>
                  <p>Or thirdly, He inſiſts only upon this as by a ſurpluſage of reaſon, inferring the other;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170260:20"/>that if men ſhould periſh for not doing good, what ſhould become of thoſe who did evil?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to meet perhaps with thoſe who contented themſelves with a negative righteouſneſs, to meet with the Scribes, and Phariſees, and civil perſons.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That he might condemn that ſin of perſecution; if men ſhould be damned for not comforting the Saints, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thoſe that did perſecute them?</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Conſider that the Lord in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wil not onely judge men for outward acts, but for thoughts; alſo, that the Lord ſearcheth and tryeth the Reins and Heart, and knoweth thoughts. I need not prove it; I hope it is granted on all hands; and if this be granted, it wil follow as I have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Lord judgeth for theſe things, or elſe why ſhould he ſearch to know them: But if it be not plainly deducible from thence; then conſider, that it was part of the Lords charge againſt the old World, when he proceeded to judgement with it for ſin, in ſuch a ſevere manner, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. <hi>And God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great upon the earth, and that every imagination of his heart was onely evill continually.</hi> He makes uſe of the wickedneſs of the thoughts,</p>

Conſider his faithfulneſs in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; he is <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> with Souls, he is at a word; what he promiſeth he gives, and much more then what we can expect. <hi>David</hi> uſeth this as an argument, becauſe there is no unfaithfulneſs in him; there was never any Soul that ventured on any promiſe of his, that ever found him worſe then his word; nay when he promiſed, and that very largely too, and by them hath heightened the deſires and expectations of his people, he hath reſerved to himſelf a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of coming in beyond their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them which love him.</hi> If theſe conſiderations were faithfully laid together, and ſeriouſly weighed and applyed to our ſpirits, would they not perſwade us to draw that concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we finde upon the ſame account, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Who would not fear thee, O King of Nations?</hi> and if we do not learn the skil of ſetting the Lord in ſuch conſiderations as theſe before us, we ſhal never excel in his fear.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Head follows; <hi>How this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering and ſetting God before us, doth make way for, and advance the fear of God in our hearts. I</hi> ſhal explain this in the enſuing particulars.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:170260:24"/>
                  <p>Firſt it ſerves to ballance and ſix the vain, light, and frothy unconſtant ſpirit of man: it helps much to the putting his heart into a ſerious frame by ſetting the glory of the great Omniſcient and Omni-preſent God before him; men will be more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in their behaviours, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to be in the preſence of ſome great one; the want of this makes men vain and vile in the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.11, 12. <hi>And they ſay, how doth God know? and is there knowledge in the moſt high?</hi> Behold theſe are the ungodly who proſper in the world, they increaſe in riches; doth God know? ſay they, we are not under the eye of the Lord; and therefore we need not trouble our thoughts about him; and what follows? theſe are the ungodly; ungodlineſs in practice muſt needs follow thoſe that have caſt the thoughts of God farre from them; but would not much of the vanity of our ſpirits and the formality of our hearts be beaten down, if we could but ſet the glory of the Lord this day before us? if we did conſider with whom we have to do in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; would it not adviſe us to ſeriouſneſs in our addreſſes to him? ſurely it would be a curbe and check to the vanity of mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which doth now wonderfully encreaſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170260:25"/>through the neglect of a due and ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It would much help forward the fear of the Lord, by humbling and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of us before him. Humiliation is the very ground work of holineſs here; and as this work thrives in the Soul, ſo doth the work of Sanctification proſper in and upon us; therefore whatſoever doth conduce to the perfecting or advancing the work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation in the Soul, muſt needs help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the true fear of the Lord, and the work of Sanctification; but there is nothing that doth more naturally humble the Soul then a true ſight of God. This we may ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Then ſaid I, Woe is me, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> And in <hi>Job</hi> 42.5, 6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee; wherefore I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi> We ſee how one glance of God did work upon them; how much more would a continual frame of behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in his glory, and as he hath been preſented, bring creatures down to lie in the duſt? O therefore if you would have much of the power of Sanctification, ſtudy the Soul humbling and abaſing Truths and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170260:25"/>Attributes of God; it is a ſeaſonable advice to our times.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it crucifieth the World, and keeps that alwaies under a cloud before us; and how neceſſary this is to the furthering of the fear of the Lord, let thoſe ſpeak who have much to do in the world, and any thing to do with their own hearts; they ſhal find, that the faſter the world dies to them, the more they ſhall live to God. The ſoul never thrives better in Spiritual things then when the world and the glory of it is vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it; for then the affections have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Spiritual things, and the World hath leſſe influence upon them; now this ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of God, helps on theſe two waies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 By drawing our hearts to look through the Creature unto God. Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 By directing us to look down from God upon the Creature. If we take it the firſt way, then it crucifieth the World, by leading the Soul through the viſible to the inviſible glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 20. <hi>For the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead; it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not the Soul to ſtick and loyter in the ſurface of any created glory, but it ſtrives
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170260:26"/>to comprehend him who fils this and that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with his glory.</hi> The Soul uſeth the Creature as a man uſeth a pair of Spectacles to look through them; and he is not buſie eying them, though he looks ſteadily upon them, but he is taken up in eying the letters and words, and things which he diſcerns through them; this is the true uſe of the Creature to look through it, and not to be bounded and terminated in it; and the Soul that ſets the Lord much before him, learns thus to paſs through every thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, who is the center of his thoughts; and by doing ſo the affections are fixed with the glory of God, and it takes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle notice of the Creature which it paſſes by, having a more excellent object in his eye.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider it in the ſecond way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, then it crucifieth the world; thus it looks down from the Lord to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo it beholds it at a diſadvantage; and this view of the Creature either leſſens it, or darkens it; as we ſee, if a man behold any thing from the top of ſome high Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it ſeems very ſmal to him, what it doth to him that ſtands level with it; ſo it is with men that converſe with God, and walk with God, they behold the Creature afar off, and much beneath them, and they ſeem not ſo bigg to them as they do to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170260:26"/>thoſe who ſtand upon the earth; for by this means the Creature is darkned; as we find by example, That if a man looks ſteadily on the Sun, he ſhal find a miſt upon every thing that he beholds immediatly after; ſo let a Soul that hath been contemplating, and conſidering the goodneſs and glory of <hi>God,</hi> take a view preſently of the Creature, and how cloudy and miſty wil it appear?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It ſtirs up choiſe breathings, and longings after God, and the enjoyment of him; the Soul by lying on God in Chriſt, begins to ſee him as the only deſirable one, the choiſe good, the ſuitable and the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, and from hence proceeds choiſe breathings after him; ſee one of theſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27.4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple.</hi> Here was one that was enamoured after <hi>God,</hi> and his wayes; he had ſeen ſo much of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency of God that he was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully taken with it, and would wiſh to ſpend all his days in the beholding of it; this frame we finde the Diſciples in when they had but a glance of the glory of Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> 17.4. <hi>Master, it is good for us to be here;</hi> and theſe experiences beget choiſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170260:27"/>breathings. <hi>David</hi> would ſpend al his time not only in beholding but enquiring alſo; beauty diſcovered begets breathings ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcoveries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The more God is ſeen, the more deſired; he did not dream of a contemplative life as ſome doe, wherein we ſhould be onely buſied in beholding, and be freed from enquiring; he deſired no ſuch perfection. We do not finde ſo many choyce breathings of any of the Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as of <hi>David;</hi> and indeed there is enough ſpoken of him, to teſtifie him to be a man of the choyceſt affections; and one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this was (as <hi>I</hi> ſhall afterward ſhew you from hence) he was a conſtant eyer of God, he was ſtill in his thoughts; from hence did ſo many ſweet breathings flow; ſee a few of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God, my ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God; when ſhall I come and appear before God!</hi> There is panting and thirſting after God; yet hee goes higher in his affections, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 84.2. he longeth, yea even fainteth, and yet he exceeds, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.20. <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longings that it hath unto thy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> What manner of breathings were theſe after the Lord, and after his ways! all theſe did flow from an experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170260:27"/>taſte of God, and the excellency of his ways; and when the Soul hath found out the ſweetneſs of the preſence of God, and his ways, it wil no longer be contented with broken ciſterns which wil hold no water; it wil not live upon that which is not bread, and which ſatisfieth not, but it flies to God and Chriſt, and nothing elſe wil ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the ſoul, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.1, 2. <hi>It ſays to it ſelf, as the Lord ſaith, Wherefore do you ſpend money for that which is not bread, and your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for that which ſatisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your ſoul delight it ſelf in fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; there is bread and water, and marrow, and fatneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will up</hi> (ſays the Soul) <hi>to my Fathers houſe, there is bread enough and to ſpare.</hi> Oh, if we did but eye the Lord more, we ſhould be more acquainted with thoſe choiſe breathings of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It begets an aſſimilating love; the diſcoveries of God made out and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the Soul, in a conſtant and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frame of eying God, do wonderfully move the Soul to love, raiſe very ſtrong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and theſe do ſtrongly carry the ſoul after likeneſs and conformity to the good which we ſee and know of God; the Soul would fain be like him, and doth by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170260:28"/>degrees grow into the Image and likeneſſe of that beauty and glory which it behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the Lord. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from glory to glory.</hi> Souls that are much converſant with God in Chriſt, and are much in admiring and beholding God in him, do grow much (although perhaps inſenſible to themſelves) into the Image of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It makes Souls active and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; good thoughts make way for good deſires, and they for good actions; how much of time, and of the man do vain and unprofitable thoughts take up? and what is the fruit of them? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4, 6, 7. <hi>The wicked through the pride of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance will not ſeek after God; God is not in all his thoughts; he hath ſaid in his heart, I ſhall not be moved, for I ſhall never be in adverſity.</hi> Verſ. 7. <hi>His mouth is full of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and deceit and fraud, and in his tongue is miſchief and vanity.</hi> Vain thoughts make way for wicked deſignes and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes; ſhut him firſt out of thy thoughts, and next deny him in thy works; ſo on the other hand, the eying of God feeds and furniſheth the ſoul with ſweet Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170260:28"/>of him, and the fruit of ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in a fruitful converſation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night. And he ſhall be like a tree planted by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon, and his leaf alſo ſhall not wither.</hi> He joyneth theſe two together; as <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ewes did conceive by eying the Poplars, ſo doth the ſoul by eying God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, It brings in a ſweet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledge of God, which is as fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto the ſoul. Now nothing doth ſo glew the ſoul to God and his ways, as this taſt and relliſh which the ſoul gets of them; and the ſweetneſs is gotten very much in meditation, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 104.34. <hi>My meditation of them ſhall be ſweet.</hi> When he had ſpent the whole <hi>Pſalm</hi> in beholding the ways and works of God, he draweth this concluſion, <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet;</hi> He would not lay aſide the thoughts of God; when he had ceaſed ſpeaking, he would then to another duty which ſhould yeeld him no ſmal comfort; and what ſweetneſs this was he doth excellently expreſs elſewhere, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63.5, 6. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs; my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips.</hi> Verſ. 6. <hi>When
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170260:29"/>I remember thee on my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</hi> And in the connexion of the fifteenth and ſixteenth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the one hundred and nineteenth <hi>Pſal.</hi> you ſhall find delight as a fruit of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the things of God; <hi>I will meditate on thy precepts, and have reſpect to thy ways.</hi> Verſ. 16. <hi>I will delight my ſelf in thy ſtatutes, and will not forget thy word.</hi> The heart that ſticks cloſe with God, and carries him much in his eye and thoughts, is never wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of beholding of him; all other Objects do breed a loathing and wearineſs in the ſoul; but it is not ſo here; the longer a ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with God, the more delight it hath in him; enjoyment breeds hungrings; and thoſe being always ſatisfying, but not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, breeds an inconceivable delight in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Que. 3. <hi>How ſhall I do to keep the Lord in mine eye continually?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall lay down ſome quickening conſiderations, which wil both engage us, and aſſiſt us in this duty, and then give ſome practical directions to further it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider that God hath an eye continually upon thee, and this will help thee always to eye him; we know that if we are in any company, and obſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the perſons one who does particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170260:29"/>obſerve us, we are engaged much in our eyes to that party; we ſhal hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear eying ſuch a one as we obſerve to eye us; thus it would be with us, if we did but conſider that the Lords eye runs too and fro, and obſerves exactly all our ways, it would help us much to ſeriouſneſs, as being in his preſence. I ſhall propound a few Scriptures to ſhew you what uſe they make of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; for I am confident that there is very little uſe made of it on all hands; what manner of men ſhould we be, if we did but walk up and down as a people who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways under his eye? we ſhould be more mindful of him, if we thought he did more mind us. <hi>David</hi> makes the ſame uſe of this conſideration which I bring it for, Pſalm thirty four, and the fifteenth, <hi>The eys of the Lord are upon the righteous;</hi> he brings this unto the young-man to preſſe him un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o the fear of the Lord, Verſ. 11. <hi>Come yee children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</hi> He lays down the duty in general, and branches it into two particulars, and preſſes all with this, <hi>The eys of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. There it is principally uſed to the Saints, and we find this very place quoted by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.12. <hi>For the eyes of the Lord are over the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and his ears are open unto their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170260:30"/>prayers.</hi> And the wiſe man makes it an univerſal argument to all ſorts, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the young man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.20, 21. <hi>And why wilt thou my ſon be raviſhed with a ſtrange Woman, and imbrace the boſome of a ſtranger? For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and hee pondereth all his goings.</hi> Nay, preſſes from hence not only circumſpection in our actions, but in our words too; to watch the tongue, to weigh every word that cometh out of our lips, <hi>Prover.</hi> 15.2, 3. <hi>The tongue of the wiſe man uſeth knowledge aright, but the mouth of fools poureth out fooliſhneſſe.</hi> The eys of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good; hee is adviſing to a diſcreet and wiſe ordering of words, not only to ſpeak according to knowledge, but alſo according to diſcretion, to do and ſpeak every thing and word ſeaſonably, and ſuitably, and to edification; and this he urges from this, <hi>Thou art under the eye of the Lord;</hi> and what ſad effects the want of this conſideration hath brought forth, let the Scripture, beſide our ſad experience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Hear what account <hi>David</hi> gives of this, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 10.11. <hi>He hath ſaid in his heart God hath forgotten, hee hideth his face, hee will never ſee it.</hi> Hee rips open the heart of the wicked, and ſhews the reaſon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170260:30"/>of his practical wickedneſs. We have the very ſinews of ſin that ſtrengthen the hands of wicked men; <hi>They ſlay the widow; and the stranger, and murther the fatherleſſe, yet ſay, the Lord ſhall not ſee, neither ſhall the God of Jacob regard it.</hi> If thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt therefore be found walking in an even path, and avoid the ſteps of the wicked, keep thine eys upon God; and that thou mayeſt do this;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider that God will eye thee whether thou eyeſt him or no: its the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a picture when it is drawn ſo that the eye of it is upon thee whereſoever thou ſtandeſt to behold it; the Image of God is rightly drawn upon thy ſoul when thou ſeeſt his eye is alwaies towards thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider that thou liveſt no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then whilſt thou art preſent with God, and God with thee; whilſt thou walkeſt without God in thine eye, thou lieſt under a cloud, and a damp is upon thy ſpirit; cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deadneſs muſt needs ſeize u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on thy heart when it is withdrawn from the eye of the ſun, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>11. <hi>Thou wilt ſhow me the path of life, in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy; at thy right hand there are pleaſures for evermore;</hi> As the Epicure ſaid, <hi>A man doth live onely whilst he doth enjoy his pleaſure;</hi> So may I ſay, Thou doſt live no
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170260:31"/>longer then thou art with God. See what the Apoſtle ſayes of ſuch as are ſtrangers to the life of God, <hi>they have a name to live but are dead;</hi> or if thou art not altogether dead, yet thou liveſt only in the root, as the tree doth in winter, when the leaves and fruit fail; who can tell whether it be alive or dead? there is little difference between a dead one and that; So indeed it is with the people of God; whilſt they neglect this great duty, there is little difference betwixt carnal people and them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider how thou art engaged to this duty as thou profeſſeſt thy ſelf a Chriſtian: it is thy duty as a Profeſſor to walk as Chriſt walked. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelfe alſo to walk even as he walked,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6. If thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt know how he walked, conſult with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord alway before me; becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved:</hi> And if you doubt whether this be meant of Chriſt or not, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25. <hi>For</hi> David <hi>ſpeaketh concerning him, I foreſaw the Lord alway before my face, for he is on my right hand that I ſhould not be moved.</hi> You ſee the fruit which is from hence; ſtability in the ways of God; therefore he had aſſurance that he ſhould not be moved.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:170260:31"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider this was <hi>Davids</hi> frame, and therefore not onely imitable, but attainable alſo, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25 15. <hi>Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord,</hi> Pſalm 139.17, 18. <hi>How precious alſo are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the ſumm of them! If I ſhould count them, they are more then the ſands; when I awake I am ſtill with thee.</hi> Why ſhould not this engage us, and encourage us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour this thing? ſeeing that the Saints of old have attained unto it, why ſhould we not go and do likewiſe?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider ſuch a frame of ſpirit is very dear unto the Lord; and a People that ſo live are very precious unto him; he ſets much by ſuch a people, who carry him much in their eye, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name.</hi> God will be ſure to think upon thoſe for good, who think much upon him; the Lord enters their names upon the Liſt for preſervation, takes ſpecial notice of them; Not that we ſhould think that the Lord hath any need of a Regiſter to keep things in remembrance; but that the Lord might hereby (ſpeaking after the manner of men) give his people good aſſurance that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170260:32"/>they ſhould not be forgotten by him; that whoever were neglected in an evil day, theſe ſhould be provided for; theſe are his Jewels as he calls them. Now we know if a houſe be on fire, a man will run and catch the Jewels that he hath in his houſe, or the Children that he hath, and ſave them from the flames; Thus will God ſave his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ones. Oh here you may ſee how good it is to have God in our thoughts; for one thought of him ſhall not be loſt; God will not only cauſe their prayers to return into their boſoms, but their thoughts ſhall come home at ſuch a time.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Conſider ſuch a frame will bee very ſweet unto thee; thou wilt find it at preſent a very choice frame of ſpirit, to have God much before thee; <hi>David</hi> found ſweet refreſhments here, when he could not find any comfort from any viſible thing; he then had it in his thoughts within him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 94.19. <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my ſoule,</hi> Pſalm 139.17. <hi>How precious alſo are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the ſum of them? David</hi> ſeems to be raviſhed with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the thoughts of his heart; he does as it were, travel with a deſire to expreſſe that ſweetneſſe which he found in the very thoughts of God; and becauſe they were
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170260:32"/>inexpreſſible, he propounds this in a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord, who only was able to give an anſwer, <hi>How precious are thy thoughts, O God!</hi> The worldlings thoughts, or the wantons thoughts, or the voluptuous mans thoughts are not, cannot bee half ſo ſweet unto him, as the thoughts of God are to a ſoul that ſincerely converſeth with him.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Conſider that the more thou converſeſt with God, the ſweeter will his name and waies be unto thee; when thou haſt once made entrance into this duty, and haſt taſted the ſweetneſſe of it, thou wilt not know where or when to end. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking in commendation of the ways of God, hath this expreſſion, <hi>I know no end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> And in that <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy Commandment is exceeding broad.</hi> He ſpeaks out eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his experience in this thing; that hee had ſeen an end of the perfection of every way but of this. A man may finde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſweet in creatures, but he ſhal quickly come to the end of it; only in the ways of God he finds a large field; there is room enough for his ſoul; he may travel all his daies in them, and never find an end of their perfection here. He was like the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170260:33"/>waters; the man that ſets his hearton any thing beneath Chriſt, ſhall find his bed too ſhort to ſtretch himſelf upon; he crowdeth his ſoul into a narrow room and place where he cannot be at reſt; but the ſoul that is buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Lord in meditating upon him, has a large place to walk in; there is no end of his glory, nor of the ſweetneſs of his ways. We may ſay of them truly, as the wiſe man ſaith in another caſe, <hi>The eye is not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſeeing, nor the ear with hearing.</hi> They were not onely <hi>Davids</hi> work, but his recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.111. <hi>Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage, they are the rejoycing of my heart:</hi> And this exceeding ſweetneſs which he found in the thoughts of God, did multiply his thoughts. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.17. <hi>How precious are thy thoughts, O God!</hi> and the ſoul multiplies the thoughts according to what they yeeld of delight unto it, as the Bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fals on that flower which yeelds the moſt honey.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Conſider how thou haſt carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world in thine eye conſtantly for many dayes, and moneths, and years without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion; thou didſt never walk up and down but thou didſt carry thy worldly thoughts with thee; either thoughts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or pleaſure, or preferment, thou haſt carried them to thy bed, and brought them
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170260:33"/>from thence again, they have companied thee ſleeping as well as waking; thou haſt had no leaſure for God, nor for a ſerious thought of thy ſoule, no not ſo much as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Ordinance; how many vain, baſe thoughts haſt thou brought to the hearing of the Word, and to other duties! there has been no time nor place wherein thou haſt been free from carnal thoughts: Oh now ſtudy to keep thy heart, thy thoughts as cloſe to God, as thou didſt then to the world; carry as much of God now with thee into the world, as thou didſt then bring with thee of the world into the things of God; it is but reaſon that thou ſhouldeſt follow God with the ſame affections &amp; deſires that thou didſt then follow thy pleaſures and profits; with what face can we profeſs that we love God, and that our thoughts are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, when he is lower in our thoughts, or leſs in them then other things either are or have been? See the Apoſtles Argument <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 19. <hi>I ſpeak after the manner of men becauſe of the infirmity of your fleſh; for as you have yeelded your members ſervants unto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and to iniquity unto iniquity; even ſo now yeeld your members ſervants to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto holineſs.</hi> May I not uſe the ſame? is it not a reaſonable thing, and plain to the judgement of man, that you
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170260:34"/>ſhould honor God as much in your thoughts as ever you diſhonored him, and give up them to him, as you did formerly give them up to ſin and vanity? now remember what the frame of thy ſpirit was when thou wert vain, thy thoughts conſtantly ſo; there was not room for one ſerious thought of God, when thou wert carnal and worldly, and ſet upon thy pleaſures, thy thoughts were all that way, and alwaies ſuch. O now think it not enough to begin to be ſerious; but be as ſerious for God as ever thou wert for the world and ſin. Make it thy buſineſs and thy deſign; now labour to keep thy thoughts as buſie about the Lord as ever thou didſt about any thing in the world; remember the Lord expects a proportionable acting that we act for him, at the rate that we did againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Thou wilt never repent of living near the Lord, when thou comeſt to dye; the time which thou haſt ſpent this way, in e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170260:34"/>nor yet cared to know; then thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in him whom thou haſt known, and loved, and hopeſt to ſee, with whom thy thoughts have been long before; when death ſhall come to ſurprize others, it ſhall deliver thee; and when God ſhal come as a ſtranger, and an enemy to them, he ſhal be as a long-experienced friend to thy ſoul; then thou ſhalt reap the benefit of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements which men called melancholly thoughts; and he whoſe thoughts were not as thine, wil wiſh his end might be as thine. When <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> lay on his death-bed, asking a friend that came to viſit him what news he brought, and he told him none? well ſaith he then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ile tell you news.

It will be with ſuch as it was with Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> who cryed out, <hi>O my ſoul, whither art thou going! thou art going where thou ſhalt never be jovial nor merry more. O my ſoul whither art thou going!</hi> Men do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſhake off theſe thoughts; but when they come to dye, they are eaſily confuted; they live now as if there were none to out-live them but their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as if there were no God, nor no ſoul to ſurvive; their very lives ſpeak the very language of the great Turk when he was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170260:35"/>dying, and his Doctors told him he muſt prepare to go to another world; <hi>Is there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world when I am dead?</hi> he thought all had died with him; language fit for thoſe filthy Dreamers of our days, thoſe ſuperannuated hypocrites, who have worn out all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, who ſay men dye as Cats and Dogs, and therefore they live like Beaſts. But as an Antidote againſt the evil of their ways, carry this along with thee, Labour to do thoſe things now which thou wouldſt wiſh thou hadſt done when thou comeſt to dye, and leave thoſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done which thou ſuppoſeſt will not yeeld comfort in that hour.</p>
                  <p>Having laid theſe things down as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to quicken to the duty, I ſhall give ſome practical directions to guide you in it, and to further Souls who would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have their hearts ſet in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant frame for God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Direction. Have an eye upon thine own heart, and that will conſtantly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter occaſions to thee of looking after <hi>God;</hi> thy wants, or enjoyments, temptations or deliverances, hopes or fears will adviſe thee to draw nigh to him; not conſidering the preſent frames &amp; tempers of our hearts, makes them ſo little God-ward; if we were acquainted with our ſelves, we ſhould be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170260:36"/>leſſeſtrangers to him. That man is happy who carries ſo much an eye over himſelf as to know in what frame of ſpirit he is; That man ſhall never defer his going to God, for want of an errant; for his own ſelf obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will furniſh him for matter of duty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for meditation or action, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of change with which his heart is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed wil checker his whole life with prayer, and praiſe; God is not like to be far from that mans eye and heart, who is not farre from himſelf, who is converſant at home. If you will be found in a good and conſtant frame for God, labour to know thy preſent frame whatever it be: the knowing of the frame of thine own ſpirit doth much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the bettering of it. But if thou lookeſt not after thine own heart, but letteſt it run at random, thou art not like to find it much with God; a heart not watcht, is loſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When thou haſt gotten ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with thy heart, and findeſt it wandring from God, labour to ingage it as much as thou canſt to this duty; lay the weight of the duty before thee, with the excellency, neceſſity, and benefit of it, with the danger of neglect, and ſee what thou canſt bring thy heart unto, and try whether this wil not engage it to be more with God.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170260:36"/>We have a notable paſſage for our direction in this caſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <hi>He ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; for who is he that engages his heart for God?</hi> God promiſes to bleſſe the deſires and endeavours of ſuch as take ſome pains with their hearts in this thing; <hi>I ſee ſaith the Lord ſuch an one, what pains ſuch a poor creature takes to draw his heart to me, and how he tuggs and labours at it. Well ſaith the Lord, does he ſo? and cannot he for all this bring his heart to it? Doth he complaine of the difficulty of the duty? I will cauſe him to draw near; Jor I have ſeen how he hath laboured to engage his heart. David</hi> hath an expreſſion very full, to ſhew how much he had to do with his heart to draw it to God, or keep it cloſe with God, <hi>I have forced my ſelf to keep thy ſtatutes.</hi> The word that is here tranſlated to <hi>engage,</hi> it ſignifies to engage by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, or to become a Surety for any one; ſo it is uſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.32. <hi>Thy ſervant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Surety for the Lad,</hi> ſo that he intimates that often covenanting with our hearts, and often covenanting for them with God, is a means to keep them intent upon him; and though when we have done all, we are too weak to deal with our hearts, yet God takes notice of thoſe who deal moſt with their hearts, and bleſſes it unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170260:37"/>which they drive, which is to draw near unto him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve thoſe clouds which do moſt of all take God from thy eyes, and watch againſt them, and where thou meeteſt with that which hath once proved a ſnare to thy Soule, and a vail betwixt God and thee, walk with a holy fear, and wait for a double portion of Grace at ſuch a time; What is it that doth lead thy ſpirit? Is it thy employment, thy recreation, thy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thy cares of this world, thy carnall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations or companions? it is ſomething thou meeteſt withal often, or is it ſomething thou doſt but ſeldome meet? if it be a conſtant ſnare, then thou haſt need to be alwayes watchfull becauſe of that; if it be ſuch a one as ſeldome moleſts thee, be ſure thou be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful, and conſider how much grace thou haſt need of, to wade through that which hath once ſpoyled thee. A man that is robbed by the way ſide, will ſtill remember the place where he loſt his Purſe, and will be ſure to look well about him when he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that way again, and go provided to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf; if we did but weigh every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and what temptations are in it, or may be in it, and then conſider what grace is needfull to bear up a Soul in the ſame, it would wonderfully help our ſpirits to a ſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170260:37"/>watchfulneſſe, and conſtancy. I am now to go forth in my employment, and I find my ſpirit is ready to be too eager and intent upon the things of this preſent world, that I can hardly keep God in my eye; how great care ſhould I have now of my heart! it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day loſt in that Wilderneſſe in which I am now travelling; I am now to go to my meat, yet I finde that in eating and drinking it is hard to ſet God before me; how ſhal I do for proportionable grace for this? So I am going into ſuch company where I have loſt my heart, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Lord; oh now for ſuitable grace to this condition. Thus if we would weigh the inconveniences of every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and watch againſt them for hereafter, it would wonderfully help us againſt a drowſie dead frame of heart.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Call thy heart often to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count where it hath been; how little with God, and why ſo; and by this means thou ſhalt find out every back-door that thy heart hath to ſteal out at from God in a day. <hi>David</hi> propounds this amongſt his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to further and to engage men in the fear of the Lord, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4.4. <hi>Commune with thine own heart in thy bed;</hi> do it on the bed, then thou mayeſt be ſtill and quiet; thou canſt not plead an excuſe from diſtractions;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170260:38"/>then thou mayeſt argue it out, and have lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure enough to do it; this employment, nor that, will not call thee off. Do it on the Bed in the end of the day, not to exclude other times and ſeaſons, but eſpecially do it then when the work of the day is done, then call thy heart to account, as Maſters uſe to do their Servants when the work is over; and this time is the moſt fit and ſeaſonable time for this duty, becauſe in the evening time thou maiſt finde that which in the morning thou couldeſt not foreſee; the morning is for the engaging and preparing; but the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for examining the heart; for thoſe holes at which thy heart eſcapes from thee, in the day, thou couldſt not diſcern; but in the evening by peruſing thy heart thou mayeſt eaſily diſcover. A man goes about his houſe and views it in all parts, but cannot tell where the Theif ſhould break in, or go out, and is very ſecure, thinks himſelf ſtrong; but when the houſe is broken open, and his goods taken away, he traces the Thief by his foot, and he finds which way hee is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped, and he labours to fortifie that place which he did not ſuſpect before; ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be with ſome of us, we take a view of our Souls in the morning, and wee think all is well; we go forth in the ſtrength of reſolution to keep cloſe with God,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170260:38"/>but the houſe is broken open, and the heart is gone by ſome back door, which we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did nor could fore-ſee: The way to finde out this eſcape, is, to view the houſe after it is broken open; and by this means thou maiſt finde that it is eaſier to finde a gap then to fore-ſee it, and when thou haſt found it, get it ſhut; by this means thou maiſt in time finde out every door and hole, at which thy wandring heart goes out from God in the day.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Take heed of walking contrary to thy own light; for the ſinning againſt that will bring forth curſed effects, which do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly deſtroy this frame of ſpirit which I am preſſing to.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this; It blindes the Soul, and by this means in time it will be ſo that thou wilt want an eye to watch thy wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Soul, and when thou haſt put out thine own eyes, thou art like to be a ſad Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. If we conſult with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom</hi> 1.22. <hi>becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankfull, but became vain in their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned;</hi> we ſhall find that there is no ſpeedier way to loſe our light then to ſin againſt it; the very Heathens ſinned away that light they had; and if thou ſinneſt againſt more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170260:39"/>light, thou maiſt loſe more; a ſinal injury done to the eye makes a man ſee the worſe for a time at leaſt, if it do not endanger the loſing it; walking contrary to thy light in ſmal things, may diſ-enable thee to ſee great things for a time; labour ſo to walk, as fearing to ſin away that light in which thou deſireſt to behold God and thine own ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, walking contrary to light, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in ſmal things, doth eſtrange the heart from God; every ſin ſeeks a ſhelter, but eſpecially ſin againſt light loves not to behold the light; we do not love to look much on them whom we cannot behold without a bluſh. Guilt newly contracted, and freſh in our eyes, doth eſtrange the ſoul from God; the creature is unwilling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him; as we ſee in <hi>Adam,</hi> he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; eſpecially if it ariſes from ſin againſt light, no ſin doth ſo much ſeparate from God as this; the ſenſe of the ſin of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the perſwaſion that we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſins of ignorance, are not ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of communion with God, as the ſin againſt light; for although they do humble us before God, yet they do not ſtir up ſuch a fear and ſhame in us as this does, which obſtructs our addreſſes to God; and the reaſon is plain; for when a man hath done
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170260:39"/>an injury to his neighbour ignorantly, he can eaſily go and excuſe it; but when he hath no excuſe to carry with him, he is then hardly perſwaded to draw near. I appeal to experiences of Saints concerning this Truth; whether it be not a hard thing to look upon <hi>God,</hi> when guilt ſticks freſh on the ſoul? <hi>I</hi> am ſure <hi>David</hi> found it thus, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Remember that in the midſt of all thy deſigns and endeavours in this thing, that thou live not upon them, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt; neglect no duty which may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate this great duty, but remember to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve as if thou didſt uſe no means. Live upon the ſtrengthening promiſe; for it is the work of Chriſt to bring over the heart firſt to God, and it is his work to keep it cloſe with God. This is the great Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe, and we are to wait for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it in the uſe of means, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>After thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people;</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. God hath promiſed to heal the back-ſlidings of the ſoul, after promiſes and endeavors, and engagements, and back-ſliding thoughts, and revolts of the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt; thou canſt not keep
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170260:40"/>up with God, ſee what God ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Return to me ye back ſliding children, and I will heal your back-ſlidings;</hi> And in Hoſ. 14.4. <hi>I will heal your back-ſlidings, I will love you freely:</hi> See, what precious promiſes are theſe for ſouls to take hold of: We find how difficult it is to keep cloſe to God; lay theſe to heart, take theſe promiſes and melt them into petitions; who knows but that the Lord may do great things for thee, if thou wilt wait for him in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, when he puts out his greatſtrength, and communicates a kind of omnipotency to poor ſouls? what is there too hard for him who knows how to uſe a promiſe as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? I hint this, Becauſe I find many ſouls to abuſe the promiſes of God ſtrangely, and therefore reap but little comfort from them; they take the promiſes and turn them into tryals, and onely examine themſelves by them, and neglect the very end of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: As for example, they take a promiſe, and ſay, God has promiſed ſuch and ſuch things in Chriſt to his people, as to put <hi>his Law in their hearts,</hi> and to keep them <hi>from departing from him, and to heal their back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;</hi> but I fear it is not ſo with me, I do not find theſe things in my heart, therefore I can take no comfort in the promiſe. This is a wronging of the Promiſe, as much as if thou
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170260:40"/>ſhouldeſt ſay, I wil believe God when I ſee his word fulfilled, and not before. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was given thee to comfort thee, and to ſupport thee, when nothing elſe could; when the Sun is clouded, and thou ſeeſt the want of theſe things, which the promiſe holds forth, then thou art to beleeve and rely on the promiſe; this is to uſe it as a promiſe: If thou doſt this, thou ſhalt find them migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through Chriſt, and him near at hand to help thee in all thy ſtreights; And be ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that the uſe of the promiſe muſt not take thee off from other means preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; neither muſt other means take thee off from the promiſe; but in the uſe of all means herein lies the great ſtrength, in the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Labour for an experimental taſte and knowledg of God in Chriſt; this wil be the ſweeteſt and ſureſt means to keep the ſoul intent upon <hi>God; Where your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>there your hearts will be;</hi> now no ſoul can make God and Chriſt his treaſure, but the experimental ſoul; he that hath not taſted how good the Lord is, cannot ſet his heart upon him ſo as to make him his portion and inheritance; But the ſoul who hath had a taſte from <hi>God,</hi> and ſeen what engagements are from thence to keep cloſe to God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7. to 14.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170260:41"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> quickly caſt away all when he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of Chriſt; <hi>but what things were gain to me, thoſe I accounted loſs for Chriſt:</hi> his ſenſes were ſpiritualized, and he does not content himſelf with a taſte, but he would <hi>comprehend;</hi> but I follow after, <hi>that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of Christ Jeſus;</hi> he endeavours to that, <hi>So reaching forth to theſe things which are before,</hi> verſ. 13. and he <hi>preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the mark,</hi> verſ. 14. All theſe ſhew how an experimental relliſh of the goodneſs of God doth engage the heart to him. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> hints thus much, that there was nothing more conducible to the fear of the Lord, then this taſte of him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34.8, 9. <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is good; bleſſed be the man that trusteth in him. O fear the Lord ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him:</hi> He cals upon to taſte and try how good God is, and then to fear him; Plainly implying, that if he could perſwade men to make trial of God and his ways, he ſhould engage ſome of them to fear him, from the experience of the ſweetneſſe of them; and the Apoſtle makes uſe of this as an argument to preſs after growth in grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby, if ye have taſted that the Lord
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170260:41"/>is gracious:</hi> Intimating, that it could not be but they who had any experience of the grace of <hi>God,</hi> and of his goodneſs in Chriſt, muſt needs be hungring and thirſting after more communion with God; if you would therefore keep up your hearts cloſe to <hi>God,</hi> ſeek for a taſte, look out for experimental knowledge; it is this that wil endear God to your ſouls; If we did labour to ſet up more precious and high eſteem, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thoughts of God in our hearts, we ſhould endeavour to break through every condition to him. What is it that draws the carnal heart after the world, but a kinde of ſweetneſs which his earthly diſtemperate pallate taſtes in it? What is it that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> long ſo much to go back again into <hi>Egypt?</hi> was it not the garlick, and the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, and becauſe they had taſted of theſe, and ſeen the Land, and the fruitfulneſs of it? they were going into a Land of which they had heard, but had not ſeen; therefore they often wiſhed themſelves back again; and therefore the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſend out ſome to ſearch the Land, that they might bring of the fruit of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.21. <hi>And they brought a cluſter of Grapes, of the choiceſt to commend the Land.</hi> Thus it is with us, whilſt we make a profeſſion without experience, it is no wonder that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170260:42"/>our hearts keep not cloſe to God; we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to follow God whom wee know not; but the world we know, that is always with us; we have experience of the ſweetneſs of it, and what it yeelds; therefore we cleave more to that, then to the Lord, until he ſends us a cluſter of the firſt ripe grapes, ſome firſt fruits of the Kingdom of Heaven; If we have not a little of Heaven in our way to Heaven, we ſhall never ſeek it with intention of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Labour for a clear ſight of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; <hi>Pulchrum &amp; meum, Beauty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi> do very much ingage the heart; things that are beautifull are (very much) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive; but if we have an intereſt in them they ſeem the more beautiful. 'Tis a great help to conſider of the excellency and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God and of his wayes, above and beyond the World and the pleaſures of it; but when we can conſider God in relation to our ſelves, then he is much more comely and glorious; when we can ſay not only God is good, but My God is good. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety does wonderfully knit, and glue the heart (we ſee) to its object in all things; and ſo it will in ſpiritual things; an intereſt in Chriſt revealed and cleared to the Soul, doth marvellouſly engage it to him, and quickens it in its acting heaven-ward; ſee for this
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170260:42"/>
                     <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>If ye be then riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things that are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God; ſet your affections on things above, not on things of the earth; for you are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God; when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle argues ſtrongly with them unto a Spiritual life, and conſtant frame of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing after Chriſt and Spiritual things, from their intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, which was very clear, and without ſcruple to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their ſouls; and we have the ſame improvement made of this which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorts to here, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in heaven from whence we look for the Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt draws the Soul much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, to be conſtantly looking for it, and into it, and this cauſes the Soul to bend unto it: That Soul cannot be long a ſtranger to Heaven, who knows a Saviour there: O labour therefore to keep your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt clear and plain, if you would keep your hearts conſtantly active, and yearning towards Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Follow thy Prayers, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what becomes of them; if thou doſt ſo, they will carry thee much to God; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170260:43"/>in the day what thou diddeſt pray for in the morning, and in the night what thou didſt aske in the evening, and live as one that waiteth for returns; this will be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means to keep thy heart buſie with the Lord either in a waiting believing frame for ſomething thou haſt ſought of God, and is not yet given in, or els in a thankful frame for ſome anſwer of prayer. As you are before prayer to ſum up your wants, ſo after the duty conſider of your Petitions, and What you have ſought of God for the day, and wait for ſutable returnes. Haſt thou prayed for a holy humble heart, for an active frame of ſpirit, for ſtrength againſt ſuch particular corruptions or temperations? how doth the Lord anſwer thee in theſe things? What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns hath this day brought forth of prayer? if any, then there is way made for another duty of praiſe; if it hath brought forth none as yet, then there is work for faith to live upon God, and to wait for him untill he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and ſpeak peace. This was <hi>Davids</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency when be had prayed, and ſpred his want before the Lord, he had not done with them, but he waited to ſee what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of his prayer. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 5.3. <hi>My voice ſhall thou hear in the morning O Lord, in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> Here is a double
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170260:43"/>care in praying to hit the mark; to ſtudy his wants, and after prayer I will not loſe what I have prayed for, for lack of looking after it; I will wait to ſee what anſwer the Lord will give to me, according to that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8 <hi>I will hearken what the Lord God will ſpeake;</hi> and like a beggar that comes to the door and in begging opens his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, preſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If we could but follow our prayers as worldly men do their deſigns, we ſhould ſeldome let the Lord go out of our eye; if we could but conſider our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and our preſent tempers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170260:44"/>them, would it not minde us when our hearts are out of frame? this is not the frame of ſpirit which I begged of God this day, I ſought other things of God when I was before him: ſuerly this is not an anſwer of my prayers, they are loſt this day for ought I can ſee; I do not find that humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſelf-denial, heavenly-mindedneſs, that watchfullneſs, zeal, &amp;c. which I prayed for this day. O did I pray for ſuch a cold, drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, dead frame of ſpirit as now I am under? If theſe kinde of reaſonings were taken up, they would ſerve to bring our ſpirits into praying frames again when they are fallen.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Keep an eye and an ear open unto Providences; they will hint much of God to thee; he is wonderfull in his goings; and in every condition if thou art an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of God, thou ſhalt find a rod or a ſtaff, and either of theſe will adminiſter occaſion of drawing nigh to God; if thou haſt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to keep the Fire conſtantly burning upon the Altar, thou needeſt not to want fuel to keep it alive: every Providence and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God will (if well and wiſely improved) afford thee ſomthing to keep thy heart flaming toward God.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, Loſe not the Book of the Creatures that is alwayes open before thee, and in it much of God to be ſeen: although
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170260:44"/>he be not fully revealed in them, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him you may finde there the very Heathens ſaw ſomething of God in Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. and ſurely thou maiſt read enough in the Book of the Creatures to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe Atheiſticall thoughts which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in mens ſpirits, and are the very flood-gates as I have ſhewed you, unto pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall wickedneſs; thon maiſt ſuck out ſomething out of one Artribute, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of another; and although all theſe are too weak to declare the Father, yet he being revealed in Chriſt, theſe may be <hi>Memento's</hi> to thee, becauſe they are always before thee. I may ſay as Chriſt ſaid once, <hi>Me you have not alwayes with you, but the poor you have.</hi> You have not Chriſt alwayes nor Saints, nor Ordinances always, but the creatures you have alwayes with you, theſe are conſtant Preachers, and therefore fit remembrances. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.1.2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But you will ſay, When the day is gone, then the night wraps up the Firmament in a Mantle, and takes it away from our eyes; what ſhall we converſe withall then? he anſwers this; Then thou haſt the Night; that is a creature; and who-ever thou art, and where-ever thou art, thou haſt Day or Night, Light, or Darkneſſe, and theſe teach knowledge; thou canſt not want an Inſtructor, or one to minde thee of God, ſo long as the Book of the Creature is before thee; and this he proves, is never ſhut night nor day; but alwaies legible, and in every page there is ſomething to minde thee of the glorious God; and ſurely <hi>David</hi> got
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170260:45"/>abundance of knowledge and choiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by obſerving the Creation, and had many ſweet frames of ſpirit, and choiſe breathings from hence; and when God was about to inſtruct <hi>Job,</hi> and to furniſh him with an holy and humbling knowledge, he opens to him this book of Nature, and ſhewed him abundance of his glory there; and although he ſpeaks of many Creatures to whom we are ſtrangers; yet of many again which are not; ſo intimating that there was enough to be ſeen of God among the Creatures moſt uſual and beſt known to us, to mind us, and to affect us with the Majeſty of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, Compare thoſe daies and hours which thou ſpendeſt with God, in thine eye and thoughts, with thoſe which thou ſpendeſt without him, and try which of them do bring thee moſt comfort; examine thy heart in thy bed, at the end of this day; compare a day wherein thou haſt walked in a ſweet, holy, humble frame, wherein thou haſt walked with an active ſpirit for God, with another day wherin thou haſt bin cold and dead, and formal, and careleſſe of thy heart, and forgetful of God, and weigh the fruits of theſe two daies walking together, and ſee whether there be not a vaſt differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt theſe. What joy and rejoicing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170260:46"/>was in the midſt of thy thoughts? thoſe days and hours were ſweeter then theſe which have been ſpent in vanity; wilt thou not conclude I had more peace with my ſpirit, and ſpiritual joy, and rejoicing after every day ſo ſpent? yea the very remembrance of thoſe hours doth yeeld ſom ſweetneſs to me now when I think of them; but theſe hours which have been ſpent without God, Oh they are burthenſom to my ſoul when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them; I will therefore return and ſtudy to keep cloſe with God, in whom is all my ſtrength and comfort, for it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with me then, then now.</p>
                  <p>Having now finiſhed theſe three Queries, I come to the fourth and laſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To inquire <hi>why the wiſeman directs this to the young man rather then any other?</hi> Methinks I hear the young ones ſaying, This is not counſel fit for us; it is a yoke not ſuitable to our necks; we are tender and not fit for the yoke as yet; hee might well have ſpared us, and given us the liberty of our youth, before he had put us upon ſuch hard and difficult ſervice as this.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall indeavour now to anſwer ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Objections, and to ſhew the equity and reaſon of the Preachers exhortation; and I ſhall be the larger in this thing, from theſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170260:46"/>three moving Conſiderations, which have put me on this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe of that common plea which is found in the hearts of young ones; they ſay as thoſe did by the Prophet, <hi>It is not yet time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe the Lord hath caſt me into a place where there are abundance of young ones, and I fear but a ſmal company of ſo many that are ſeriouſly ingaged in their hearts to the Lord and to his waies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe I find very little incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from old ones; I ſee every where that God brings in few of them; they are ſo ſetled on their Lees that there is no ſhaking of them. It is the obſervation of all men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in theſe daies, that where the Goſpel is preached, the ſucceſs and incouragement is chiefly, if not only, on the hearts of young ones; we ſee that God puts but little of the new wine of the Goſpel into old bottles; they are ſo tainted with their ſuperſtition, their carnal compliance, formality, and luke warmneſs, that God doth generally caſt them aſide as unuſefull; the time is now coming when the Lord is making good that word, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. <hi>Let him that is filthy be filthy ſtill;</hi> Let them that have cleaved to their ſuperſtitions and will-worſhip, do ſo ſtill; let thoſe who have prophaned
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170260:47"/>Sabbaths, and Ordinances, do ſo ſtill; and let thoſe who have ſate Sermon proof, and Judgement-proof, and Mercy proof, ſit ſo ſtill. Me thinks the Lord is ſaying ſo to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance in this place, who have not been moved, nor wrought upon, nor changed by all the gracious pleadings of God in the Goſpel; and he is now calling in to himſelf a generation of young ones to hear his name in this place; and therefore my ſpeech ſhall be principally to you, the youth of this place to perſwade you to ſet ſeriouſly about this work of God, and your poor ſouls. It is to you that the Lord calls at this time.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſhould the youth be ſet a part eſpecially for God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For theſe Reaſons. 1. Becauſe God hath made choice of this time, typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in the Law, in the firſt born, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Sanctifie unto me the first born; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever openeth the Womb among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>both of Man and of Beaſt it is mine.</hi> God hath commanded this for himſelf, becauſe it is the beſt of our time, as the firſt born was the prime of the ſtrength, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.3. Ruben, <hi>thou art my firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, my might, and the beginning of my ſtrength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.</hi> Now in regard of this it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a great loſſe to loſe the firſt-born.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170260:47"/>God puts this as an ingredient into that plague in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 4.23. <hi>And I ſay unto thee, let my Son go that he may ſerve me, and if thou refuſe to let him go, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will ſlay thy Son, even thy firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.</hi> Oh how do men bring this plague upon themſelves, who deſtroy their firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born? their youth, the beginning of their ſtrength. It is as bad as the ſacrifice of the Iſraelites who offered their Sons and Daughters to Devils.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord typifieth this in their firſt fruits, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.26. <hi>The first of the firſt fruits of thy Land thou ſhalt bring into the houſe of the Lord thy God:</hi> Exod. 22.29. <hi>Thou ſhalt not delay to offer the firſt of the ripe fruits, and of thy liquors, the firſt-born of thy Sons ſhalt thou give unto me.</hi> Nay, the Lord was ſo exact and punctual in this, that he would have no exchange made, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.14. <hi>And they ſhall not ſell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firſt fruits of the Land, for it is holy unto the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here may be a Query raiſed, <hi>Why the Lord would not ſell thoſe, and yet would ſuffer, nay commanded that their ſons ſhall be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?</hi> Exod. 34.20. <hi>All the firſt-born of thy Sons ſhal be redeemed, and none ſhal appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me empty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:170260:48"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. To ſhew how much Equity and Reaſon there was for that Law, that it is made here with a proviſo againſt any charg.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There was mercy in redeeming the one, and the not redeeming the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Lord by ſuffering the Sons to be redeemed, did injoy the ends of that Law; for they were only redeemed from death, they were ſtill his.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſay, as God would not have an exchange in this caſe, ſo it is vanity in any of us to think of compounding the buſineſs with him; he will have the beginning of thy ſtrength; do not thou ſay, I wil give him the dregs of it; ſay not the latter daies are good enough; for he hath choſen the firſt; and if thou wouldeſt be accepted with him, obſerve his choice: Obſerve the firſt Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that we read of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4. Cain <hi>brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the Lord, and</hi> Abel <hi>brought of the firſtlings of his flock, and the Lord reſpected him and his offering.</hi> One brought fruits, the other the firſt fruits, and he reſpected the one, and not the other; and yet this was before the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Law of firſt born, and firſt-fruits; which ſhews that it was not ceremonial but moral, and ſo continues for ever, as a ſtanding rule for a creature to offer up the firſt and choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt of everything to God.</p>

                        <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.</head>
                     <p>This is the choiceſt of thy time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fitteſt for ſuch deſignation, moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the great work of the Lord; which will appear if you conſider theſe following particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Thy affections are ripe and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing; and if thou doſt now give up thy ſelf to the work of the Lord, thou mayeſt in all probability bee ſerviceable to him; but in thine old age, all thy affections wil be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; eſpecially thoſe which ſhould moſt of all render thee ſerviceable to God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Thy Affection of Love, and Joy, and Zeal, Deſire and Hope, which do moſt of all quicken ſouls, and honour the work of God in their hands, theſe will be all fallen, and there will be nothing left but weakneſs, and faintneſs, and fear, and paſſion, and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs; and how will theſe things honor the Lord? O it is very neceſſary that wee ſhould have an eye to our Affections in the great work of God; for if theſe bee loſt, the glory of the work falls to the ground; for the affections are the very hands that lay hold on Chriſt, and the feet that run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and the inſtruments with which we work for him; loſe not this time if ever
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170260:49"/>thou wouldeſt take a time wherein God may be glorified by thee.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Now all thy ſenſes are freſheſt and quick, and thy ſoul moſt active, and thou art beſt able to taſte of that ſweetneſs which is in the ways of the Lord; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſweetneſs of the ways of <hi>God</hi> do not conſiſt in ſatisfying the ſenſes external, neither is godlineſs (as the Familiſt makes it) a ſenſual life, yet when the body is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and the ſoul weakned, as to all its exerciſes, the ſoul is not deprived onely of the reliſh which it had of carnal things, but even of ſpiritual ones alſo; the reaſon why we ſhall enjoy ſo much more of God in Heaven then we do, or can do here, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our bodies ſhal be fitted to our ſouls; we ſhal have none of the incumbrances of fleſh, and weakneſs, and indiſpoſition through ſickneſs and old age, which now do hinder us; and therefore it muſt needs follow, that the better the ſoul is Organized and fitted for action, through the ſtrength and vigour of all the faculties, the more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable it is of communion with God, and of taſting the ſweetneſs that is in his wayes. Bring a man that is ſick and weak never ſuch precious and pleaſing meat and drink, he affects them not, becauſe his palate is weak, and he cannot taſte the ſweetneſs
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170260:49"/>that is in them. Old Age is the ſickneſs of Nature; then ſhe begins to be feeble, and it cannot be expected that the ſoul can act at the ſame rate either in Naturals, or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, which it did when it was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of its ſtrength; A man cannot do ſo much work when his aſſiſtants and ſervants are all gone from him, as he could when he had them all at command; the ſoul wants many of her attendants, they are dead, or drouſie, and very uſeleſſe; every member of the body, and every faculty of the ſoul is very weak and lame, and there is little expected from them. If ever thou wouldeſt highly put a difference between the ways of God, and the ways of ſin, and thou wouldeſt reliſh the ſweetneſs that is in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lord Jeſus, make tryal in thy youth, whilſt thou art in the prime of thy ſtrength; for the breaſts of his conſolation are ful, and require much ſtrength to draw them, they are of ſo pure and ſpiritual a nature. If thy ſenſes were ſo quick and comprehenſive as <hi>Adams</hi> were in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet there is more then enough in the Lord Jeſus, and in his ways to exerciſe them, and to ſatisfie them; <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks largely of his experience in this thing, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. <hi>They were ſweeter then the honey, and the honey-comb.</hi> And in Pſalm one hundred
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170260:50"/>and nineteen, he commends them beyond all other good things, and ſpeaks elſewhere of this; he ſets out the fulneſs and variety of ſweetneſs which the ways of <hi>God</hi> afford by this expreſſion, <hi>Rivers of pleaſure.</hi> Pſalm 36.8. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſſe of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the rivers of thy pleaſures.</hi> We may have another much like to this, Pſalm 16.11. <hi>In thy preſence is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of joy, at thy right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> O what a great miſtake is there amongſt many, who refuſe to give their youth to the Lord, becauſe they cannot ſpare that from their pleaſures; they think that the devoting that unto the Lord would be the ſpoil of it; let not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten delude any of your poor ſouls thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more; there are pleaſures at Gods right hand, and rivers of pleaſure for Souls to drink of who follow Jeſus Chriſt, when the ſummer brooks which Satan leads you to will all be dried up. Le thim not draw you off from God, with a pretence that there is no pleaſure to be had in him; but whenever he draws you after pleaſures, tell him how that you have heard, That the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y of God are ſweet, and that you will make tryal of them, whether they are ſo or not, whilſt you are in the midſt of your ſtrength, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170260:50"/>beſt able to diſtinguiſh betwixt ſweet and bitter, good and evil; and when thou haſt gotten but a taſte of the ſweetneſſe of the ways of God, thou wilt have an anſwer at hand for him; when he comes and tells thee, Thy youth is fitteſt for pleaſure, tell him then it is fitteſt for God at whoſe right hand are pleaſures everlaſting, which thon wilt never more exchange for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable luſts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Now thou haſt an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to deny thy ſelf for Jeſus Chriſt, and to commend the ways of God unto the world, and to ſet a high price upon them for the enjoyment of Chriſt in them, when thou doſt deny the vain pleaſures of ſin when thou mayeſt enjoy them; what a low value doſt thou ſet upon Jeſus Chriſt, and the ways of the Lord, when thou wilt follow him at no other time, but in that which in thy own judgement is fit for nothing elſe, although in truth it is moſt unfit for that? This cannot bean act of ſelfdenial, when we wil never come to <hi>God</hi> til we have nothing to deny, or part withal for him; thou canſt not then ſay that thou forſakeſt any thing of the world to come unto Chriſt, when it hath already forſaken thee; what pleaſure wilt thou deny to follow <hi>God</hi> in thy old age, in that day when thou ſhalt ſay, I have no
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170260:51"/>pleaſure in it? here wil be no room left for ſelf denial in many things, but now it lies in the way evidently to make out thy ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; for now whilſt thou art in the ſtrength of thy dayes, and many temptations to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the world, and many ways to enjoy it alſo; now to renounce all, and come into Chriſt, will be an eminent act of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; all men will ſay, loe here is one who hath left all to follow the Lord; and wil not this beget an high eſteem in men of the ways of God, when they ſhall fee thee pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing it above all profits, and pleaſures, and preferments, and Friends, and Companions? when they ſee thee caſting theſe under foot, when they are to be enjoyed; will they not ſay, Surely there is much ſweetneſs in the ways of God, that this man denies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in all theſe things to follow them; If ever thou wouldeſt honour the ways of God, and ſet them up high in the hearts of men, and be eminent in this act of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, loſe not thy youthful days, but begin to follow the Lord Jeſus whilſt the world and the pleaſure of it are following thee; ſo ſhalt thou be a true Diſciple of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The work is great which thou art called to, and therefore fitteſt for thy youth; we know that we uſe to ſingle out
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170260:51"/>the morning for the choiceſt employment, which requires greatneſs of ſtrength, and parts; and truly the work of the Lord is in this ſenſe a morning work; for it will call for the vigor and ſtrength of thy affections; <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, Luk.</hi> 13.24. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I preſs toward the mark for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Men do wonderfully miſtake the ways of the Lord, when they think that the ſleeping doating age is good enough for him; truly this is according to thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and fancies which they have of the worſhip of <hi>God;</hi> and their thoughts are ſo low, becauſe they are ſo much ſtrangers to it; but if ſuch ſouls were ſet truly about the work, they would find it ſo much above the ſtrength they have (when ſtrongeſt) that they would eaſily be convinced of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of making delays, and putting it off til a time when they muſt expect leſs. Oh what folly is there in mens hearts! and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon wil thoſe delayers have to ſtand by them at the laſt day? when they delay the workbecauſe it ſeems hard and difficult, and yet they put it off to a time wherein it muſt needs be much harder then now it is. Friends, take heed of this folly, it is too common amongſt us: It is againſt reaſon and againſt our practice in all other things, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170260:52"/>if the devil had not a great power over men this deceit of the heart would be diſcerned; we ſee men will not do ſo in other things; they will ſtudy the ſeaſon proper to every work but this of their ſouls; the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will not put off his Summer work till Winter, nor his Winter work til Summer; he wil chuſe to do the work that is moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and laborious before the heat of the day if a man walk by the Sea wal &amp; find a ſmal breach that is made in upon the Land, he will not paſſe it by, and ſay let it alone until the next week or year; for ſays he, it will grow much bigger by that time; he will not make delays when he is ſure that delays will make more work; let us but ſtudy the ſeaſons for our ſouls as they do; let us do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing to the beſt advantage; the work is great, begin when thou wilt; but the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it be before thou begin it, the more difficult thou wilt finde it, and the leſſe ſtrength thou wilt have to go through with it; therefore begin in thy youth.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, It is a long work, and therefore calls for the morning of thy Age; he that would run this race ſhould ſet out early. We know if a man have a long Journey to go, or a Race to run upon ſome forfeiture, he will covet for as much of the day as it is poſſible for him to enjoy, he will ſet out very early
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170260:52"/>by the firſt appearance of day; if we did but know what it is to be a Chriſtian, we ſhould not think our day too long to ſpare any of it from our work, eſpecially of our choyceſt hours.</p>
                     <p>Three things makes this work long.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Want of knowledge, we have many things to ſeek after.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Want of experience in thoſe things which we have in notion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Much imployment.</p>
                     <p>Firſt in regard of knowledge, we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin betimes; how many things are we igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of? the Goſpel is ful of Myſteries, &amp; the Worſhip of God is a Myſtery, and we know but in part when we know moſt, and yet may always know more then we do; If we conſider our Naturall eſtate, we are ignorant of every truth of God as it is in Jeſus; we know nothing aright, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man cannot perceive the things of God;</hi> therefore ſeeing there is no true knowledge of God, and of Spiritual things, till we ſet our faces and hearts Heaven-wards, we had need begin betimes. If we look to our after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, which is a fruit of converſion, it is ſo weak and imperfect, and there is ſo much ignorance in ſo many of the things of God, that then we ſhould ſay, O that we had begun ſooner with God! then might
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170260:53"/>we have been teachers of others, whereas now we have need to be taught the very principles of Chriſt; if we begin at the firſt hour of the day, yet we ſhall find the work ſo long in this regard, that when the night comes we ſhall acknowledge that the day hath not been large enough; or we have not been active enough to be acquainted with every Myſtery of the Lord, and we muſt leave ſome things to learn when we come to Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In reſpect of Experience; how many things are there which we get in notion, which we are content withal, and ſeek not for the experience of it? this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much time to ſeek after the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and power, and conformity to thoſe truths of which we are convicted in our judgements; thou maiſt learn many things in a Notional way in a ſhort time; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all theſe things is not ſo ſoon obtained. The Phyſitian reads many things, and they ſeem rational to him; but this ſeems not enough to him until he gets ſome experience of theſe things, til he hath made trial of them; it wil require much time for thee to put every truth ſo to the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone as to be able to ſpeak to it from thine own experimental Knowledg; and this will adviſe thee to begin betimes with the Lord.</p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:170260:53"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, In regard of imployment; O when thou comeſt into Chriſt, thou wilt find abundance of work to do, too much for the little time that is allotted thee; if thou lookeſt upon thoſe without, to labour to bring them in to Chriſt, thy bowels wil ſound toward them, and thou wil ſay in thy heart, O that I had come in ſooner, that I might have pittied thoſe poor ſouls ſooner; in regard of thoſe who are within, there are ſome weak, and they call for thee, <hi>When thou art converted, then ſtrengthen thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> ſome are doubting, and call for thee to comfort them; ſome are fallen, and cal for thee to reſtore them; yea the ſtrong as well as the weak have need of thee; O there is work enough for thee to do amongſt the Saints, if there were none in the world, if thou hadſt <hi>Methuſalem</hi>'s Age to ſpend. And ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt hath ſo much work for poor Souls to do, is it not pitty that thou ſhouldeſt defer thy coming, when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath need of thee! O that we did but love our work as wel as that precious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt did, who wept when he was to dye, becauſe he ſhould go where he ſhould do no more work, but ſhould only receive his wages! if he mourned that he was to leave working ſo ſoon, we ſhould much more lament that we began ſo late.</p>

As the Husband-man when he goes to a good Fair, or Market, he goes up and down to ſee where he may buy a good penniworth, that he might ſtock his ground for the year following; and when he hath once bought for his turn, he looks not how the Market goes, nor what others do; now thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneſt to leave the childiſh age, which is trifled away with toys, and thou beginneſt to look towards hereafter, what thou maieſt faſten upon? What will be moſt beneficial for the time to come; now thou bethinkeſt thy ſelf how to ſpend thy enſuing daies; be very wary, take heed thou doſt not make too raſh a choice; walk up and down the Market, and ſee who ſells the beſt penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth; Satan will have his ſhop open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and he will offer thee great things if thou wilt beleeve him, the pleaſures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and honours of the World; but take heed of a haſty Market; have an eye to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſee what terms he offers to thee, whether he do not offer better things upon better terms: And to preſs this duty cloſe up-</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Conſider how dangerous it is to forget God now in thy chuſing time; leſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards pre-engagements to the world blind thee that thou ſee not, or prejudice thy ſpirit that thou ſee with diſadvantage; or bias thee that thou wilt not folow what thou ſeeſt of the things of God; when once the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is engaged in his Affections to a former choyce, it is a very hard thing to draw ſuch a ſoul off upon any terms almoſt; if thou loſeſt this time of thy youth, thou loſeſt thy choyceſt opportunity, becauſe now thou mayeſt be free in reſpect of many engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which hereafter may draw thee from following of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Conſider that if thou ſhouldeſt be brought over unto the Lord afterwards, when this chuſing time is paſt, it will be hard to convince men that thou followeſt him out of choyce; they will rather judge it to be out of neceſſity, if thou lookeſt not toward God till thy old age, they will ſay it is becauſe thou haſt nothing elſe to do at this time; or they will ſay it is the cuſtom of old folks to be a little religious; but if thou giveſt up thy youth to follow the Lord, al men will ſay thou doſt it out of choyce; This man hath choſen the way of the Lord, who had many other ways to go, and all pleaſant, but he forſakes them all, and hath choſen the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170260:55"/>ways of God; it was a clear evidence that <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe the Lord and his ways, when he imbraced them at ſuch a time as he might have injoyed the honors and priviledges of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Court; <hi>By faith</hi> Moſes <hi>when he was come to years, refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharoahs <hi>daughter; chuſing rather to ſuffer with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> If he had ſtaid til he had been old, and til the Court had been weary of him, and had caſt him out, there would have been no notice taken of his cloſing with <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but now it appeared plain an act of choice.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We find that men have ſeldom above one chuſing time; and if this time be loſt, and they not ſetled upon God, it is a thouſand to one but they are loſt; although the Lord may and does call ſome at every hour, yet he calls moſt at the firſt, few at the third, fewer at the ninth, and feweſt at the laſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.1, 2, 3. <hi>He went out early in the morning to hire labourers for his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. And when he had agreed with the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers for a penny a day, he ſent them into his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; and he went out about the third hour, and ſaw others ſtanding idle in the Market-place.</hi> We find, he went out intentionally to hire the firſt time, but the reſt ſeem brought in caſually; And therefore Chriſt called one
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170260:55"/>at the laſt hour, that none ſhould diſpair, and he called but one, that none upon that might preſume; take hold of youth while it is in being; old age mny never be to thee; or if it be, yet thy heart may be ſettled in youth, and hardened to thy former engagements which have cauſed thee to paſs by the Lord, and it is a wonder if he do not paſs by thee alterwards; we finde very few brought in to God in the laſt hour of the day.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 It deceives thee, in telling thee that the work is eaſie, and thou mayeſt do it as well in old age; and therefore why needeſt thou trouble thy ſelf ſo early, and lay out the prime of thy days in it, when the dregs of it will ſerve as well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here it lies; for if thou ſetteſt about this work, thou wilt finde it a hard work which as I have ſhewed will call for all thy ſtrength.</p>

                        </gap>h, have attained to a great eminency in the things of the Lord. As to begin with <hi>Moſes,</hi> he began with God in his youth, in the prime of his age. Heb. 11.24. <hi>By faith</hi> Moſes <hi>when he came to years, refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>daughter;</hi> and to what height did he grow in knowledge and experience of the Lord? How did God honour him, in giving him ſuch a wonderfull diſcovery of himſelfe in thoſe days? <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11, 19. <hi>And the Lord ſpake to</hi> Moſes <hi>face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to his friends.</hi> ver. 19. <hi>And he ſaid, I will make all my goodneſſe paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and I will proclaime the name of the Lord before thee.</hi> God ſeems to grant him as much as he was capable of on this ſide Glory, as much as he could bear, if God ſhould have let out more of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon him, it would have conſumed him.</p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:170260:58"/>
                     <p>Secondly, See how <hi>Samuel</hi> proved in the waies of the Lord? with what repute and honour he lived and dyed amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God? and he was one of theſe early beginners with God? wee finde that the Lord called him betimes and eſtabliſht him for a Prophet in his very Childe-hood, as you may ſee at large in the firſt Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> chap. 3. Now how eminent this man proved with God, in regard of his long acquaintance with God; he proved great in prayer, he was a prevailer with God, and therefore <hi>David</hi> names him as the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt this way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.6. Samuel <hi>amongſt thoſe that call upon him.</hi> And the Lord ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his memory for this, when he was in the Grave, Jerm. 15.1. <hi>Though</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſtood before me;</hi> the Lord brings in theſe two early beginners together and ſays, If any were like to prevail with me, it were theſe my two old friends, who took up aquaintance with me from their youths. We know friendſhip is deareſt and moſt engaged when it is begun in Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and continued to an old friend.</p>
                     <p>Time would fail to tell you of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> how eminent he was for God, who grew wiſer then his Teachers, and how ſoon he began with the Lord. And of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who were ſanctified
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170260:59"/>in the Womb, and what meaſures of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and grace they had; and of <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was inſtructed from a child in the Scriptures, and how ſerviceable he proved to the Churches; ſurely it is not in vain that the Scripture takes ſo much notice of the commings in of ſo many Saints, and that we find the moſt eminent of them are mentioned, and to have given up their youth to God. And if we would go by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, we ſhould find that many others of the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apoſtles, if not all, were called in to give up their Names to God very early; I am ſure it is enough to engage us to begin with him in the morning, if wee would attain to that height they did.</p>

I do not ſay but that there is a promiſe for them that return at whatſoever time it be; a promiſe to him as a ſeeker, but not a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to him as a late ſeeker. But there is a promiſe particularly to the early ſeeker,

                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.7. <hi>They that ſeek me early ſhall finde me;</hi> And from hence the Apoſtle preſſes men to take hold of the opportunity <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7.13. <hi>And to day if you will hear his voice;; but exhort one another dayly, while it is called to day, leaſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfullneſſe of ſin,</hi> and the Prophet preſſes the very ſame; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near;</hi> the Lord is near thee in the Promiſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to you young ones; becauſe he is near you in the particular Promiſe, whereas he is near others but in the general promiſe. O therefore be perſwaded to ſeek him whilſt he is thus near to you.</p>
                     <p>Uſe of Caution to young ones not to loſe this time; for we may ſay of youth as <hi>David</hi> ſays of the Soul, <hi>What ſhall a man give in exchange for it?</hi> there is no price or ranſome ſufficient to redeem it from God; the following days if thou were ſure to enjoy them and give them up to the Lord, are not a valuable conſideration for thy youth, nor will any time be ſo acceptable to God as this. See how the Lord prizes youthfull affections, <hi>Jer,</hi> 2 2.3. <hi>Go and cry in the ears of Jeruſalem ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, I remember thee, the kindneſſe of thy youth, the love of thine eſpouſals

                     <p>All theſe conſiderations laid together may help us to draw this Concluſion, <hi>Lament.</hi> 2.27. <hi>It is good for a man to bear his yoke in his youth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 To old ones who have neglected, and loſt this precious time of their youth; O go home and mourn over this great loſſe, the loſſe of your precious and choyſeſt time of your youth; go to your Cloſets, and weep over your deceitfull delaying hearts, which have cheated you ſo often, and put ſo many ſtumbling-blocks in your ways, that you

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words are ſome of thoſe which the Lord Chriſt ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, when he beheld and conſidered the ſad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable condition of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> His ſpeech is broken, as if he had ſpoken out one, and wept out another part of his mind; but
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170260:64"/>ſuch imperfect Language ſerves to expreſſe ſorrow to the life; It is eaſie to ſee the heart of Chriſt through theſe Lines, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee him here to be a Man of ſorrow. Neither are the ſtreams more viſibe then the Fountain from whence they did ariſe; you need not go farre to ſearch for the Head and riſe of this River; look but upon the eye of Chriſt, ſee where it is fixed, and you ſhall not more eaſily ſee that he weeps, then for whom he weeps; it was for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> who had ſlighted and forſaken her own mercies, out-lived the day of her Peace, and was now under a double ſentence of Death, <hi>viz</hi> Spirituall and Temporall; and although <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> rejoyced in her proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, yet he that ſaw what was written over her head, drops theſe few words (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and broken through abundance of tears) to ſhew, that the ruine and miſerie of Her and of poor ſinners goes near his heart.</p>
                  <p>Many things have been propoſed and handled from theſe words, which I ſhall not now touch. I purpoſe to mention now no more of that which hath been ſpoken from them, then will ſerve as an Appendix to the fore-going Diſcourſe I ſhal draw up all that I intend in theſe three Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That the Lord does afford men under the Goſpel day or time to make and ſecure their peace with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:170260:64"/>2 That this is very uncertain (as to us) and unknown, but it often determines and ends whilſt the meanes of Grace do continue amongſt us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 When this day is paſt and over, peace and the things of peace are hid from the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three Propoſitions are built upon theſe three things, which lye clear in the text. 1. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a day. 2. This day was now paſt and gone, yet the means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; the Goſpel was not yet carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. 3. Notwithſtanding they had the meanes, yet peace was hid from their eyes.</p>
                  <p>For the Firſt of theſe, I ſhall prove, Firſt, that God does give men a day, wherein they have more advantage then at other times, to ſecure their everlaſting peace and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I ſhall come to enquire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this day does conſiſt; That men have a particular day, is eaſie to diſcern from hence that the Lord is ſo oft urging ſinners in Scripture not to let ſlip the golden time wch he cals <hi>the acceptable day,</hi> or <hi>day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> ſee what uſe the Apoſtle makes of this <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7, 13, 15. Does not the Author ſpeak there as if Salvation did depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the improvement of a day? Does he not ſtrongly intimate unto them that there, was no way to prevent their future ruine,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170260:65"/>but to be careful of their preſent day! And the Holy Ghoſt declares the ſame truth to the ſame intent by the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near.</hi> That exhortation is preſt by theſe two motives.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That although the Lord was now to be found, yet there might be a time when he would not be found.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he might be farther off from them then now he was; they would find him at another time as it were out of hearing.</p>
                  <p>See what uſe the Saints have made, and what notice they have taken of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69.13. <hi>My prayer</hi> (ſaies <hi>David</hi>) <hi>is to thee in an acceptable time.</hi> He that was reſolved to take all advantages in his addreſſe to God, knew wel enough that this nick of time was none of the leaſt. God loves thoſe who take the firſt opportunity, whether it be the morning of the day, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63.1. or the morning of life, which is youth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. or the morning of the means, who imbrace the firſt tenders of Chriſt which are made unto them, as thoſe who were called at the firſt hour.</p>
                  <p>Further, ſee what notice the Lord takes of this, when he anſwers Chriſt in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.8. <hi>In an acceptable time have
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170260:65"/>I heard thee, in a day of ſalvation have</hi> I <hi>helped thee.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid. Thou ſpeedeſt wel becauſe thou comeſt in a good hour, in the ſeaſon of Grace, when I was in the vein to ſhew mercy; God hath his day of ſalvation, and his time of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if you wil have it you muſt come in the nick of time. You know Petitioners muſt wait their opportunities, they muſt come in ſeaſonable hours, or elſe they are lke to miſcarry.</p>
                  <p>This may in general ſerve to prove that there is ſuch a priviledged day. I ſhal now open the particulars of it; I ſhal ſhew you many helps and advantages that many men now have who ſhal periſh, and many have had who are now in Hell.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They have the Goſpel preacht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, which is the word of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt who is the Mediator betwixt God and Man, is declared, and the way to Life and Salvation by him is preached plainly, that there is no other name given under Heaven, &amp;c. Acts</hi> 4.12. It is and hath been often told them, that if they wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they ſhal receive remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. but if not, they ſhall dye in their ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>John</hi> 3.18.</p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:170260:66"/>
                  <p>Secondly, As Chriſt is, and hath been preacht amongſt ſuch perſons, ſo he is and hath been preacht without any difference or reſpect of perſons; there is no difference put betwixt noble and ignoble, rich and poor, ſtrong and weak, wiſe and fooliſh; yea no difference betwixt ſinners as to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſin, great or ſmal, from the leaſt to the chiefeſt of ſinners.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpel hath been, or is offered ſo to men that nothing can exclude them from the benefit of it, unleſſe they exclude themſelves by rejecting of it. And that I may make this plain, conſider</p>
                  <p n="1">1 They have the ſame conditions laid down which others have and had, who are now in Heaven; God did not preſcribe harder termes to the one then to the other; <hi>Believe and repent</hi> were the termes which one refuſed, and the other embraced.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They have the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to encourage them, which drew them to Chriſt who are now in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. I do not ſay, that they took the ſame encouragement from ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; how many ſouls hath that promiſe drawn to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.37. <hi>He that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out?</hi> and is not this promiſe in thy book alſo? How many ſouls have ventured upon
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170260:66"/>Chriſt from the ſupport which they had by that word, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42 3. <hi>He ſhall not break the bruiſed reede, nor quench the ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax?</hi> And is not this a word for thee, if thou hadſt any will at all to come to Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>How many hath that word drawn to Chriſt, which we find, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.1, 2. yea ſuch as could apprehend no good at all in themſelves, who upon this word have gone without money in their hand, as boldly as if they had not gone to begg but to buy? And have not all theſe things been ſpread before many who are now in hel, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to look toward Chriſt? It muſt needs be ſaid, that the reaſon why ſuch came not to Chriſt, was not becauſe they had no encouragement, but becauſe they had no mind to come.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They have, or had the ſame ground to believe that thoſe had who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the ſaving of their ſouls; they had the truth and faithfulneſs of God, which is the ground and reaſon of every ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. The faith of the Goſpel is not a believing that God hath particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elected thee to eternal life, or that Chriſt dyed for thee in particular; But it is a believing that God is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ue, and that the Record which he hath
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170260:67"/>given of his Son is true. From hence we have this expreſſion, <hi>John</hi> 3.33. <hi>He that believeth hath put to his ſeal that God is true.</hi> And unbelief is deſcribed notably, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that beleeveth not maketh God a lyar.</hi> Not that a Beleever cannot know and believe his intereſt particularly in the death of Chriſt, or be certain of Election; but the Goſpel cals upon us to prove theſe things, and infer them by reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Yet here ye muſt not think that Faith lies only in aſſent of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding only, but alſo in the conſent of the Will; I ſpeak here of it only as it reſpects the former.</p>
                  <p>How do many content themſelves with giving a general aſſent to the truth of the word of God, and yet they deny the great and main truths of it, and make God a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar in the great things which he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning eternal life! Many men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the reaſon why they ſtir no more for ſalvation, is becauſe they know not whether they are elected or not, or whether Chriſt dyed for them or not. But alas, there is ſomething elſe really at the botttom. They beleeve not the Record which God hath given of his Son. If they did believe what God hath ſpoken concerning mens natural and ſpiritual eſtates, concerning
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170260:67"/>Chriſt and ſinne, Heaven and Hell, they would look about them; But although theſe men beleeve not, yet it will appeare that this foundation was laid for them alſo, even the truth and faithfullneſs of God, into which the faith of all the Lords people ſhall bee reſolved. God propoſed ſuch termes of eternall life, annext a promiſe to them; The Elect cloſed with theſe terms, and relyed on the truth of God to make the promiſe good, and was not the truth of God engaged as much to the one as to the other, in caſe they had reſted on it?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They have and enjoy the ſame means. God preaches to them by the ſame meſſengers; he does not ſend one wiſer and more learned, or more holy to preach to thoſe who are or ſhall be ſaved; and one weake and inſufficient, or leſs convincing to preach to thoſe who periſh: But they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heare the ſame word together from the ſame perſon. Chriſt bids his Diſciples enter into the houſe where the Son of Man was not, as well as in to the houſe where he was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.5, 6. and Chriſt wrought the ſame works before the Phariſees, that he did before the Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Goſpel in offering Chriſt unto thee, ſays nothing of Election, makes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170260:68"/>no difference betwixt elected &amp; not elected. It ſpeaks not to the Elect as Elect, but as fallen, as ſinners, as poor loſt undone crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſo it ſpeaks to thee, and to all. The Goſpel ſays nothing to thee of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on until thou haſt paſt over the firſt work of Beleeving; and if thou art not elected, yet this cannot properly be a reaſon of thy rejecting Chriſt; for the Goſpel made no difference betwixt thee and Elect ones in offering Chriſt unto thee. Secondly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther didſt thou conſider thy Non-Election in thy rejecting Chriſt; Who told thee that thou wert not Elected? Nay thirdly, Thou didſt think that thou wert Elected, and yet didſt not look after Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, They have ſuch termes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that if they did come up to them, they ſhould be ſaved: Although the Lord hath purpoſed not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ave ſome men, yet we muſt not conceive that God wills that they ſhould not be ſaved upon any termes; he wills their ſalvation ſo far as they will the terms of ſalvation. If they would comply with the way and meanes which he hath propoſed and preſcribed, <hi>i.e.</hi> Beleeve &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, they ſhould be ſaved; upon ſuch terms as theſe God wills every mans ſalvation. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. <hi>And let him that will, come.</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:170260:68"/>if he will come up to the termes of Chriſt, he ſhal have of the waters of life, whoever he be.</p>
                  <p>There is a great difference betwixt Gods willing mans ſalvation upon Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel termes, and his Electing men unto ſalvation. For whom he Elects, he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely determines to ſave out of the good pleaſure of his will. He appoints the meanes as well as the end, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to give faith and Repentance to ſuch, to incline their hearts, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them to himſelf. Thus he wills the ſalvation of the Elect.</p>
                  <p>But he wills the ſalvation of all men otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> upon ſuch and ſuch termes. If they wil make uſe of ſuch meanes as he gives them, and come up to his termes, they ſhall be ſaved; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not. Nay, he gives them ſo much as to leave them inexcuſable at the laſt day, and to make it evident that he wil'd their ſalvation more then they did. It wil be then clear, that had many men will'd their ſalvations upon thoſe terms which the Lord did, they had been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how does that appear?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thus; God was willing to give thee ſalvation, if thou wouldeſt turn to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170260:69"/>him. But thou didſt never will it upon ſuch termes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.14, 15. Thou wert willing to be ſaved, but it was if thou mighteſt keep thy old Luſts ſtill; thou wouldſt not buy ſalvation at ſo dear a rate as Converſion. So that we may ſay, that the reaſon why many a man is not ſaved, is not becauſe God would not, but becauſe they would not. There were termes propoſed by the Lord, and there was nothing that parted the Lord and them, but their wills. As in the caſe of the young man in the Goſpel, whoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate parted Chriſt and him. Was it not his wil that undid him? Dare any ſay, that if he had come up to the termes of Chriſt, he had not been ſaved? Chriſt made him a firm promiſe upon a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which only parted Chriſt and him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.21. And what was it that undid <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Pſalm 81.13. <hi>Oh that Iſrael had walked in my wayes,</hi> &amp;c. Did <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuffer becauſe God was not willing to bleſs and proſper them? Surely no; But becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not ſeek it in the way which God was willing to beſtow it. Had they will'd their peace in the way that the Lord will'd it, they had had it. And ſo in the Text, did wicked men wil their own ſalvation, as the Lord does, they ſhould be ſaved.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:170260:69"/>
                  <p>Seventhly, They have ſome inward meanes and helps to make their day of peace the cleerer. The Spirit of God does ſtrive with them in his word and works, and ſollicites their return, but they will not obey it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. Thus the Lord ſtrove with the old world until he was weary. This was it which <hi>Stephen</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 7.51, <hi>Ye do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> To this we may add that of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19. God did not onely preach by <hi>Noah</hi> whilſt he was preparing the Arke, but by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alſo, convincing them of ſinne, and warning them to repent. Now that you may ſee how farre the Lords affords inward meanes as well as outward to many that periſh, I ſhal lay down theſe few particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He inlightens their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which before were wholly darkned, and gives them the knowledg of many Goſpel truths, yea ſometimes in ſuch a manner and meaſure, that they are able to teach and inſtruct others, and to tel others what is to be done, when yet they themſelves wil not doe what they direct others unto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.19.20. Thus <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> had ſuch gifts and knowledg, as made them for a time ſerviceable to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170260:70"/>others, yet they ſerved not the intereſt of their own ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſhews them the equity of his wayes, ſo that he cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that what the Lord requires is juſt and reaſonable, and ſo alſo what he threatens, and yet they have no wil to do the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. The Heathens were convinced that God would judge their wayes, and he would puniſh them with death, and they could not deny the juſtice of this ſentence; How much more are many convinc'd ſtrongly of this, who live under a ſearching Miniſtry? To this we may adde that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Thou approveſt of the things which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</hi> God inlightens them ſo far that their judgements are for him, though their affections are for the Devil and ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He moves ſo far ſometimes until he ſtirre up ſome kinde of reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in them, and Conſcience grows ſo hot that nothing wil quiet it but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of promiſes to do ſomething in anſwer to ſuch Convictions, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. Thus <hi>Felix</hi> quieted his Conſcience when it was in a flame, by telling it he would hear <hi>Paul</hi> and it another time.</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170260:70"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, He moves ſo ſtrongly upon the heart of a ſinner, that he cannot be quiet unleſſe he do ſomething for the preſent in obedience to that word which is ſet cloſe to him by the Spirit of God. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and did many things, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He ſqueezes a ſweetneſſe out of his wayes upon their ſpirits ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſo that they are convinc'd that it is good following of God. Thus the ſtony ground received the Word with joy. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20. And <hi>They tasted of the heavenly gift,</hi> Heb. 6.4. They had ſome peace in their ſpirits, and comfort in the hope that ſin was pardoned, and this ſeemed a ſweet thing to them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, He gives them ſome taſte of the powers of the World to come, as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> had, <hi>Numb,</hi> 23.10. He had ſtrange Convictions of the povvers of the World to come. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avv that a mans happineſſe did not lie in the things of this life; But there vvas another life vvhich vvas prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be cared for, and look't after; He knevv that the people of God had a happineſſe reſerved for them in that life which was more then all the pleaſures of this. He knevv that they vvould be the happy men vvho had feared and loved
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170260:71"/>the Lord, yet he loves not them although he deſired their Condition; He would have curſed them for wages, yet he deſired to be bleſſed with them. Thus you ſee God goes farre to ſtirre thoſe who are not ſaved.</p>
                  <p>I have now ſhewne you wherein a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mans day conſiſteth, and how farre it does extend, to outward and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward helps and meanes; whilſt theſe things continue which I have ſhewed you, it may be ſayd, It is day with them.</p>
                  <p>But as this day of theirs ſeemes to be ſome what cleere in reſpect of meanes; yet it is a very uncertaine day, whoſe length is onely known to the Lord. For he cauſes the Sun to riſe and ſet at his pleaſure; And although wee cannot by the exacteſt Calculations finde out preciſely how long or ſhort this day is to particular ſoules, yet we may lay down General Rules, and make ſuch Scripture propoſals, as may help men very much in judging concerning this Goſpel day; at leaſt I doubt not but to ſhew you ſo much as will cleere this truth, or <hi>Second Propoſition, That a ſinners day may end whilſt he injoyes the outward means of grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Lord brings the nigth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170260:71"/>upon a people by taking a way the means of grace wholly from them. When the Sun ſets, it muſt needs be dark; and if the Goſpel were taken quite a way, he world would be as dark as Hell. But I intend not to inſiſt upon the proofe of this. I ſhall grant that a ſinner may have all the choyce outward helps that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd continued to him, and yet this day may be over. And that will appeare</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe God may withdraw the Convictions of his Spirit from him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he injoyes the word; the Lord may ſay, as <hi>Gen</hi> 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall ſtrive no more with this man:</hi> And alas, when God hath withdrawne his Spirit from the world, to what purpoſe is it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, No onely ſo, but the Lord does hold them from ſeeing and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe things which concern their peace, as he held the Diſciples from knowing him whilſt he talked with them; ſo does he theſe men from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing ſavingly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8, 10. <hi>God hath given them a Spirit of ſlumber,</hi> &amp;c. When God hath plainly convinc'd of the truth of his Goſpel, and ſollicited their returne by many morall perſwaſions, and ſtirrings of Conſcience, and they will not receive the truth in the love of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170260:72"/>it; He then does not onely withdraw the light which ſhined convincingly upon their Conſciences, but he dos hold their eyes from ſeeing, or puts the truths of his Goſpel into ſuch a dreſs that they ſhould miſtake them. Therefore ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11, 13. <hi>I ſpake to them in parables.</hi> Thus ſays the Lord to his Word and Meſſengers; Go and ſpeak to ſuch a people concerning their peace; but I wil caſt ſuch a vayl upon plaine truths, that they ſhall not underſtand what is plainly ſpoken to them for their good Compare <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.9. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.10. and tel me whether God does not take up ſuch reſolutions as this, That the people who would not ſee at one time, ſhal not ſee at another. And how farre are ſuch a people from night, judge you?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He ſometimes hardens their hearts, and makes them heavy by that word which in it ſelf is a word of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſoftning. He hath ſaid, <hi>the word ſhall not go forth in vaine, and return emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> It ſhal do ſomething, either as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of life or of death; but becauſe they have refuſed the word as it offers life, God in juſt judgement makes it a killing word to them: as we may ſee <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6.10.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170260:72"/>it is a ſad thing when the Lord ſhoots the Goſpel as poyſoned arrows againſt the ſoul, which wil ſurely kil; yet this the Lord often does againſt ſuch as have rejected the ſaving offers of it; as we may ſee, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28.12, 13. <hi>The Lord gave them line upon line, and precept upon precept, that they might goe, and fall back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and be broken, &amp;c.</hi> But the Lord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deales thus with a people, but for ſins againſt his word, that he might by his word puniſh their diſobedience to it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He delivers them up to their own carnal looſe hearts to commit ſin with greedineſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. <hi>As they did not like to retaine God in their knowledge, God gave them over to are probate mind, &amp;c.</hi> When the heart is once grown hard and fat, that Convictions and Reproofs come not at it, or when it is paſt feeling, as they were who are mentioned <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. the next thing is a giving up of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all wickedneſs; When <hi>God</hi> gives men over to their luſts, men wil quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give themſelves over to them. You have a very ful place, which ſhews that God does thus give up ſome men. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Why he does it; and Thirdly What the effect of this is. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 81.11, 12. It is ſaid, that <hi>God gave them up to their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170260:73"/>own luſts.</hi> Secondly, The reaſon of this is, Becauſe <hi>they would not hearken to, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Lord and his counſel.</hi> And thirdly, The effect of this was, <hi>they walked in their own Counſels.</hi> The raines were no ſooner laid on their necks, but they ran away from God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God goes ſo far with ſome, that he wil not puniſh them for ſinne here; he wil not loſe one ſtroak more upon them, he wil not afford them thoſe outward means of humbling which he affords to many others. As he ſays of <hi>Iſrael. Hoſ.</hi> 4.13, 14. <hi>Your daughters ſhal commit whoredom, and your ſpouſes ſhal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery;</hi> I <hi>wil not puniſh your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your ſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes when they commit adultery.</hi> Oh it is a ſad judgement, and a dreadful, when <hi>God</hi> ſays of ſuch a ſoul, I wil not viſit him here for ſin, let him be unclean ſtil, let him be a vile wretch ſtil, a drunkard, a lyar, a blaſphemer, a Sabbath-breaker ſtil, I wil ſeem to take no notice of it, I wil not reckon with him til I have him in Hel, and then I wil reckon with him for all together. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. Let him go on, and proſper, and floriſh in his body, and eſtate, he ſhal not be croſt as other men are, that he may bleſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170260:73"/>and fal. It is one of the ſaddeſt and ſharpeſt of the judgements of God that can befal a poor creature, not to feele the ſmart of ſin here. To lye under this judgement, that he ſhal finde the ſweet of ſin onely. Oh let me tel you, it is a great and manifeſt token of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and that he is implacable when he ſuffers thee to go on quietly in a way of ſinne, and neither ſmites thee by his word, nor yet by his providences, but lets all things go to thy mind, and thee go after thy luſts.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, God gives them up to ſtrong deluſions, ſo that they who would not believe the Word and Conſcience when they ſpake truth to them, ſhal aſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards believe every deluſion of Satan, every forgery of their own corrupt hearts, and every deceit of ſin. See that of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.4. I <hi>will chooſe their deluſions ſaith the Lord, becauſe when I called they did not anſwer, but choſe the thing in which</hi> I <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted not.</hi> This is a dreadful place for ſuch as wil not hearken to, and obey the truth, when they are convinced of it; ſee another to confirm this, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved, for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them strong deluſions
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170260:74"/>that they ſhould beleeve a lie, that they might be damned,</hi> &amp;c. Oh ſuch a word ſhould make men upon whoſe conſciences God is ſtirring, afraid to dally with it. May not the Lord ſay to ſuch, If you wil not liſten to the truth to day, you ſhall liſten to a lie to morrow? I will give Satan leave to tempt, and I will give thee up to beleeve whatever he ſhall propoſe; Becauſe thou wouldeſt not beleeve me for thy good, thou ſhalt beleeve him for thy hurt and ruine.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, They may and do often fall back from moſt or all of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, which they had upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the things of God, which I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before, whilſt the Spirit ſtrove with them: as for example;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the knowledge which they had of the truth of God, they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve manifeſt lyes, in oppoſition to them, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their Judgements may be ſo corrupted, that they may paſſe againſt thoſe things which they did approve of; they were in their Judgments for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, now they may be for ſin. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.15. <hi>They call the proud happy;</hi> and whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did approve of things which are excellent, yet now they thinke it a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170260:74"/>
                     <hi>vaine thing to ſerve the Lord;</hi> and they ſay with thoſe Apoſtates <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>What profit is there in ſerving the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas he had ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions under the Word, and he made many promiſes to reforme, yet now he may be paſt feeling, as they were <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. His Conſcience is paſt all tenderneſs and remorſe, and he is <hi>ſeared with a hot iron,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 4.2.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He may lay afide that which he had taken up of the form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; whereas while God followed him with Convictions, he uſed to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſavoured of Religion, and to aſſociate himſelf with thoſe who made a profeſſion; but now let them goe by themſelves, he is not to be found amongſt them. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.15, 16. As ſoone as the Prophet had taken notice of the apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſome, he adds preſently; <hi>Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often together:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, You might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards have found the Saints by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; theſe men were not to be found in their meetings.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Whereas he had a ſweetneſs in the performance of duty, he forgets that, and returns to lick up his old vomit again, and that is ſweeter to him then
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170260:75"/>ever Religion was; and the reaſon of this is, becauſe he had pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. And although they might forget this pleaſure while Conſcience was heated, and find ſome pleaſure in the waies of God, by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying this heat of Conſcience; yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being quiet and cool again, they loſe the pleaſure which they apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ways of God, and imbrace the pleaſures of ſin afreſh.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Whereas they had ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the powers of the World to come, and ſome ſad thoughts of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were darted into their ſpirits, that they could not be quiet, the love of the preſent world, the profits, pleaſures and honours of it eat up all theſe, and they forget that there is ſuch a thing as Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be provided for, and they live only as if they were to live to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Such men do not only fall back from their Couvictions, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work of Converſion, but they go forward in wickedneſſe, perhaps not known or practis'd by them before. This we find mentioned, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Ifaſter they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170260:75"/>through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are intangled therein and overcome, the latter end with them is worſe then the beginning; for</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Men that have gone far in a profeſſion of Religion, and ſeemed to have ſome power upon them to reform them, yet the Corruption of their wils overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the light and Convictions which were in their Conſciences, and finding themſelves at liberty, they are more vile then ever. They are worſt at laſt, as is not onely aſſerted here but, in that Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.43.44.45. If the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit be caſt out by the power of Conviction alone, he will returne to his old habitation, he will come and ſee who keeps houſe, and if it be empty in reſpect of grace, and garniſhed only with a profeſſion, and with natural abilities, he will enter againe, and he will bring company enough to guard for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and they ſhall be none of the beſt, <hi>ſeven Spirits more wicked then himſelfe.</hi> Perhaps hee was a drunkard, or ſwearer, or Sabbath-breaker; But as he troubled himſelf about Religion; ſo hee trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled not the profeſſors of it. But if he fal back to theſe ſins againe, its ten to one but he proves a ſcoffer or a perſecutor
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170260:76"/>of the wayes and people of God. See an inſtance, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. There where ſome who pretended to holineſs, but when they fel off, <hi>Obſ.</hi> Firſt, They did not onely lay aſide ſuch duties, but ſtruck at them. Secondly, They ſcoffed at ſuch as walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed humbly with God. Thirdly, They joyned and ſo took part with the worſt of men. They call the proud happie. Apoſtates ſeldom ſtand as Neuters.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have I hope cleered the two firſt propoſitions, you have ſeene it both day and night with the wicked. I come now to ſpeak of. The <hi>Third Propoſition, viz.</hi> That when this day is paſt and over, the things of peace are hid from the ſoul. This is ſo eaſily deducible from the two former, that I need not ſpeak much to prove it. If a day be ſet to treat with perſons, and upon terms to conclude a peace, if they ſtand out this day, and do nothing, the Commiſſion is out of date. Thus ſays the Lord, I gave Commiſſion to my Meſſengers, to Conſcience, and to the Word, to plead and ſtrive with you about an agrement, and ye would not; Now the time is over, Conſcience and the Word have no Commiſſion to treate with thee againe; for I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt peace now.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:170260:76"/>
                  <p>Thus God dealt with <hi>Jezabel,</hi> Rev. 2.21. I gave <hi>Jezabel</hi> ſpace to repent, ſays he; But ſhe repented not; I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take another courſe with her, <hi>I will call her,</hi> &amp;c. If the day end any way, Peace muſt needs end with it. When God workes as I have ſhewne you, and they come to that paſſe, as hath beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red we may eaſily Conclude, Peace is hid.</p>
                  <p>Firſt if God withdraw from the ſoule, and give over ſtiring, Corruption muſt needs carry it. When God takes away thoſe Convictions which did reſtaine and bridle the man, he will doubtleſſe then follow his own luſts, and take fil of ſinne, commit it with greedineſs. But you ſee it evidently, God hath ſaid, <hi>my Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man;</hi> Such a man hath deſired to enjoy his Luſts quietly, and <hi>I</hi> am reſolved he ſhal have enough of it; and where wil ſuch a man ſtop, whom God wil not hinder? or when wil he returne, whom God will not draw? Corruption will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Lord it in ſuch a ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the Lord leave ſtiring wtth the ſoule, Satan wil have his wil upon it. If the Lord withdraw his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workings, Satan wil draw neere,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170260:77"/>and he will fill up the Houſe; If Chriſt rule not, he will. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets out the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of poore ſouls who are without Chriſt thus; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Satan leads them Captive at his will;</hi> and <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. He ſays <hi>they walk according to the Prince of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Ayre</hi> (i. e.) according to his mind. This is the Condition of every Naturall man. Satan hath goten ſuch a power over them, that they doe what he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. But beſides this power which Satan hath in men naturally, here is a Judiciary delivering up of Souls to the power and will of Satan when their day is over. Many who are under the firſt power of Satan may be recovered, but ſuch as come thus under his power are irrecoverably loſt and undone, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.4. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Not to ſuch as are loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> as all men are who are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in a loſt Condition, of which yet ſome at leaſt ſhall be repayred; But ſuch as are appointed to be deſtroyed, who are loſt paſt Hope. In a word, when a mans day is over, he is loſt, and peace is hid from him upon a twofold account.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In reſpect of God. He with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws the light and reſolves never more to have to doe with ſuch a poore Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170260:77"/>in a way of mercy, never to whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per one word of conviction, or of Counſell more to him concerning his ſoule, and then he that is filthy muſt needs be filthy ſtill; who will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to that mans ſoul, or ſhew him the miſery of his Condition or the folly of his waves, whom God will Counſell no more? The Sunne is ſet, and the day muſt needs be done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The day being done, peace is hid in reſpect of himſelf, becauſe he had no eyes to ſee the things of peace; They were but ſhut before, either out of prejudice, or neglect, or wantonneſs, but now they are put out, or ſealed up, ſo that they ſhal be opened no more; and then although the Sun ſhine never ſo Bright, yet the eyes being put out, he lyes under an impoſſibility of ſeeing the things of peace. This is as clear as the Sunne when it ſhines, from that of <hi>John</hi> 12.39, 40. <hi>Therefore they could not beleeve, becauſe he had blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the day of grace and peace you ſee may be over unto men, although the Goſpel in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the publique adminiſtrations doe continue as clear as ever. Thus we finde it was with ſome of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170260:78"/>
                     <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> time, as I have ſhewn you from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. Yet was he the moſt Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical of all the Prophets. And thus it was in Chriſt's time; many who lived under the Richeſt diſpenſations of the Goſpel (who heard and ſaw Chriſt, who ſpake as never man ſpake, and did what never any did) yet were paſt ſeeing, and Chriſt ſaies expreſſely at laſt, <hi>That he did not intend that they ſhould ſee,</hi> Mat. 13.10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to apply theſe truths which have been proved, I ſhall clear them from ſome miſtakes or miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions which might ariſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some will ſay, Does not that which hath been ſpoken ſtrongly infer that Chriſt died for all?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Goſpel hath plainly and fully declared that Chriſt died for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and all ſinners without exception are invited to come to him, and take <hi>freely of the waters of life,</hi> and the promiſe of Acceptance is cleare. None ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed who will come to him. So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account we have as much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in preaching the Goſpel, and can give as much encouragement to ſinners, as if we did preach univerſal Redemption; for then men could have no ſurer foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170260:78"/>for faith then the word and promiſe of God, who cannot lie, and this word they have now; <hi>He that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Who can ſay that Chriſt died not for him in particular? thou haſt no Negative; But the Lord hath left thee a foundation for hope, yea and for ſtrong Confidence, if thou doeſt not turn thy back upon Chriſt. That he died for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is clear; that thou art one is as plain; and if thou approveſt of the terms of the Goſpel, if thou deſireſt to partake of the benefit of his death upon the terms of Beleeving and Repenting, thou maiſt undoubtedly have it. If thou wilt come, God keeps open houſe, and thou maieſt aſſure thy ſelfe of thy welcom. So that as to thy encouragement to come in to Chriſt, it matters not whether he died for many, or for all; or whether for thee in particular or not; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all diſpute He came that all they that Beleeve might be ſaved: And they who ſay that Chriſt died for all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that his death ſaves none but upon theſe terms. If thou haſt a will to Beleeve and Repent, thy encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as good as any can be given thee: But if thou haſt no will to theſe things,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170260:79"/>it is no matter whether he dyed for thee or not, for thou ſhalt be damned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Controverſie. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned;</hi> ſo ſay we, and ſo ſay they who believe that Chriſt dyed for thee in particular.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But does not this which hath been ſaid ſuppoſe that man hath a free wil, and power to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and convert himſelf? Becauſe you ſay he may be ſaved, if he wil come up to the terms propoſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No. This Doctrine which hath been delivered, hath no ſuch foundation. But I ſhal lay down as ſafely and as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, yet as plainly as I can, what we are to conceive of the abilities and wil of man in this point.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It ſuppoſeth that men who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh do not do what they can; they do not exerciſe and improve that power which they have. I ſuppoſe the difference betwixt Natural and ſpiritual abilities is diſcovered in the Parable of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; He that had the ſingle Talent hid it, when they who had double Talents improved them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.20, 24. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we may by following Scripture expreſſions ſafely ſay, that the Natural mans Abilities fall ſhort in ſpiritual
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170260:79"/>performances, yet we cannot ſay, He hath no power at all in theſe things. He may do more good then he does, and he may do that which he doth better, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he can do nothing well. It is very hard to ſay how farre he can goe, although we can ſhew how far he cannot go. The abilities of nature muſt be left like a <hi>Terra incognita</hi> which hath not bin travailed over; Becauſe never any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man did go ſo far as he was able to go for God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It ſuppoſes that no man did ever periſh who did his utmoſt to lay hold upon ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. He who hath given ſuch encouragement, as to ſay that <hi>he would not break the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> wil not refuſe any who have laboured with all their might and ſtrength to come to God by him. He that ſays, <hi>he will in no wiſe caſt out them that come,</hi> doubtleſs will not caſt off thoſe who take ſuch paines to come. He that hath ſaid to ſinners, <hi>James</hi> 4.5. <hi>Draw neere to me, and I wil draw neer to you,</hi> wil alſo make it good, and meet thoſe more then half way, as he did the prodigall Sonne, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to return to him. We have a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcripture for this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <hi>He
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170260:80"/>ſhall approach unto me; for who is this that engageth his heart to approach unto me?</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid; Do you not ſee how ſuch a one tuggs and labours with his heart to draw it God-ward, and yet complains that when he had done what he can, all wil not do; his heart is ful of backſliding. I wil not ſuffer ſuch a poor ſoul to ſtand off; I will cauſe him to approach. God hath made an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſe to thoſe who labour for Heaven, and take paines as it were for life, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.3. <hi>Then ſhal ye know if ye follow on to know the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And the Lord ſays elſewhere: <hi>Then ſhal ye find me, if you ſeek me with all your hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you wil ſay; is it not ſaid <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. <hi>Many ſhall ſeek to enter, and ſhal not be able.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>many ſhal ſeeke,</hi> not <hi>ſtrive, (i. e.)</hi> they would enter if it could be with eaſe. The ſoldier who dare not or wil not venture his life in a ſtorme, would ſeek for a way to enter without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or hazard.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Many may <hi>strive</hi> (as wel as <hi>ſeek</hi>) but not to the uttermoſt; and they have no reaſon to charge God with the loſs of their ſouls, when they have not put out their abilities to the utmoſt.</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:170260:80"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Many ſtrive much, but not in <hi>Gods</hi> way, as the Scribes and Phariſes did, and as the Papiſts and many Legal perſons do, who do not ſtrive in Chriſt and for Chriſt. But there was never any that did his utmoſt for life in the Goſpel way, that did miſs of it.</p>
                  <p>The Lord did never give any poor ſoul occaſion to ſay; Lord, thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſuch a way for poor ſinners to come to life and ſalvation, and thou haſt commanded us thus to ſeek it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I would, but thou wouldeſt not; I have done my utmoſt on my part, but thou haſt failed on thy part.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It ſuppoſes that no man did periſh for want of power, which had a wil to Believe and repent. When ever the wil of a poor Creature did come over to God, there did alwayes come with it a ſufficiency of grace to lead him through all the works of grace. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were not abilities ſuitable to the wil, yet they were ſome way ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the work of Converſion. Not that I do think with ſome, That the wil of man moves firſt in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his abilities, and that the Lord then ſteps in with more grace &amp; ſtrength as a Reward of this. But I believe that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170260:81"/>God does by his ſpecial grace move the will, and ſets that (with what he hath given already) to work, and where he doth by his free grace excite what he hath already given, he doth aſſiſt that with more. God is firſt in the work of Converſion, and his grace moves the will; <hi>Pſa.</hi> 110.3. <hi>In the day of thy power thy people ſhall be willing.</hi> And when God doth begin in the wil to move that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Chriſt, he wil not ſuffer the work to fail for want of power to carry it on. God never ſtarves his own work. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>He worketh in you to will and to do:</hi> There is a neceſſary Connexion betwixt the wil and the deed. If the Lord (in his free grace) give the Will, he wil enable to do, if not what we ſhould, or would, yet what he wil accept of.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It ſuppoſeth thus much; that it matters not whether thou haſt ſuch a power to Believe and Repent, which ſome plead for. For if thou haſt a Wil to Believe and Repent, thou ſhalt not miſcarry for want of power. Follow thy wil, and thou mayeſt expect power confidently from the Lord. But if thou haſt no wil toward theſe things, and art reſolved not to make uſe of what thou haſt, it is no matter whether thou
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170260:81"/>haſt more or leſſe. If thou haſt no power of thy ſelf, yet if thou haſt a Wil, the Lord wil not let thee ſtand out for want of power. And if thou hadſt all this power in thy hand, and haſt no wil to employ and improve it for thy ſoul, it is all one as to thy ſalvation. Thou ſhalt periſh.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It ſuppoſes that the Lord doth not condemn men for what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do (although they cannot doe what he commands) but becauſe they wil not. God commands thee to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to repent, to be humbled for thy ſins, and to make thee a new heart, to forſake thy very evil thoughts. Thou canſt no more do theſe things, then the Blackamore can change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. But this is not that which will damn thee, that thou canſt not do them, but this will be thy condemnation, that thou wouldeſt not do them?—It is true; if thou wert ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of thine inability, thou mighteſt plead a cannot now, and make good uſe of it thus; Lord thou haſt commanded <hi>that I ſhould keep thy righteous judgements.</hi> But I cannot. <hi>Oh that my ways were ſo directed,</hi> &amp;c. Thou haſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me <hi>to make me a new heart, Ezek.</hi> 18.31.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170260:82"/>But I cannot. Therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Create in me a new heart, and renew aright ſpirit within me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou haſt commanded me to Believe, but Lord I cannot, I find abundance of baſe unbelief within me, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.14. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lord help my unbelief.</hi> Thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to waſh and make me clean, but I cannot; I can as ſoon waſh off the ſpots from the Leopard; <hi>Ez.</hi> 36.25. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſprinkle clean water upon me, and I ſhal be clean; waſh me, and I ſhall be whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ſnow, Pſalm</hi> 51.7. Thou haſt commanded me to love <hi>thee with all my heart, and with all my ſtrength;</hi> But <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; I find much of the love of the world creeps into my heart, and intercepts my affections, and <hi>I</hi> am ful of Backſlidings. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.40. Therefore <hi>Lord put thy Law in my heart, that</hi> I <hi>may not depart from the;</hi> in a word, Thou haſt commanded me <hi>to ceaſe from evil, and to do good.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> cannot, <hi>for I finde</hi> (Rom. 7.23.) <hi>a Law in my members rebelling,</hi> &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Lord deliver me from the ſin of this body, or from this body of ſinne. This is the uſe thou ſhouldeſt make of thy cannot, and thus improved and pleaded out with God in time, it might be of ſingular advantage to thee. But it
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170260:82"/>wil be vaine to think to lay up this plea by thee until the laſt day, and to think to ſtop Judgement by it then. For the Lord wil proceed with thee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other termes, and ſo wil fruſtrate ſuch a plea as this is; For he wil not condemn thee becauſe thou couldſt not, but becauſe thou wouldſt not believe. And when thou art found guilty of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and wilful diſobedience, it wil be in vain to plead inability. Thy weakneſs was the reaſon why thou couldeſt not believe; but it was not the reaſon why thou wouldeſt not believe. If ever thou wouldſt have pleaded inſufficiency, thou ſhouldſt have done it whilſt there was time for it, when it might have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. The buſineſs then to be proved wil be that thou wouldſt not believe, and for this thou ſhalt be condemned. <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is Condemnation that light is come into the world, and men love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more then light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It ſuppoſes that a mans can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not is from his VVil not. Therefore he cannot becauſe he wil not. There is a Twofold Cannot in unbelievers. A firſt and a ſecond. The firſt is while the day of grace does continue, of which <hi>I</hi> am now to ſpeak, and this is from his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170260:83"/>will. While God is offering to him termes of peace and reconciliation, he is wilful, and ſhuts his eys, and ears, and wil not ſee nor hear what is for his good.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſecond Cannot which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows this, a Judiciary Cannot. When man hath ſhut his eyes, and therefore could not ſee the things of his peace, the Lord ſeals them up, and ſays, From henceforth thou ſhalt not ſee any thing for thy good; this is a dreadful Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and when men come to this, they are almoſt in Hell. But I am to ſpeak of the former of theſe, (which is ſo much the more fearful becauſe it leads to this) the Cannot which ariſes from a mans own wil: the wil and affections blinde the Underſtanding, and therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee; The corruption of mandoth moſt of all appear in his wil, for this is the very ſeat of it, from whence it iſſueth forth into every part of him, and defileth the whole man; the will is the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader in good or evil. And that is not miſled by the underſtanding, until the underſtanding hath been ſeduced by that. A man is firſt prejudiced againſt ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things, he wils them not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſees not the excellency that is in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170260:83"/>them. Thus the will blindes the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and that leads the will aſide, and ſo the blinde lead the blinde, till both fal into the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tch. Thus we ſee daily by ſad experience, how mens paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or intereſts do blinde them, that they do not ſee things as they are. Men love or hate things, and then they judge them to be good or evil according to their affections.</p>
                  <p>The Natural man hates the wayes of Godlineſs, and then fancies them to be hard and unpleaſant; he judges them fooliſhneſs, becauſe they croſſe his luſts, which have gotten his affections, and therefore he cannot receive them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he loves his luſts, and therefore he fancies that they are comely and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, he is not willing to ſee the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſinne. Like ſome fond Mother, who do ates ſo much upon her childe, that ſhe wil heare no evil of it; ſhe is ſo blinded by affection that ſhe cannot ſee faults. Thus it was with <hi>Balam,</hi> who (although he had aſſurance that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be bleſt and not curſt) would faine perſwade himſelf (through the extream love of the wages of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity) that he might curſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> from ſuch or ſuch a place. So alſo is it with
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170260:84"/>men, although the word of God flie in their faces for ſin, and tels them, that if they let it not go, their ſouls ſhall go for it; yet the love of ſin and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream unwillingneſs to part with it, puts them upon ſtudying ſome excuſe or other for it, and they would fain perſwade themſelves that there cannot be ſo much danger as is pretended in keeping this or that ſin. So that the reaſon why they ſee not the evil and danger of ſin, is becauſe they are not willing to ſee. They are not willing to ſee what ſurfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drunkenneſſe will coſt them, that they ſhall have hunger and thirſt for them in Hell. They do not willingly ſee <hi>what the Lust of the eyes, the Luſt of the fleſh, and the pride of life</hi> will coſt them; that thoſe flames of Luſt ſhall be turned into flames of fire.</p>
                  <p>They are loth to ſee what covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, pride, or oppreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will come too, and therefore they conſider not the danger and nakedneſſe of their poor Souls. And who is ſo blind as he that will not ſee? Surely ſuch a blindneſſe cannot bee pleaded before the Lord, When a man is corrupted in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is hard to ſet his judgement right; For ſuch a man wil ſee nothing that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170260:84"/>might weaken his former opinion. Thou loveſt thy corruptions, thy boſom luſt; the Word bids thee cut it off, if it were a Right Hand, and pluck it out if it were a Right Eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay it bids thee do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lay. The Divel perſwades thee that thou needeſt not be ſo ſtrict, thou maieſt ſpare one Luſt, the Lord wil par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee in this one thing, or if thou muſt caſt it away, it is time enough yet, hereafter wil ſerve the turn. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Scripture be plain; and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tels thee, that if it were poſſible for thee to be ſaved, and yet to keep one Luſt, or that another time might ſerve turn to part with it, yet it were the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt way to part with every Luſt, yea and that preſently alſo; yet the Love that thou beareſt to thy Luſt does blinde thee, ſo that thou wilt ſee or hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the prejudice of it. Thou art like the deaf Adder <hi>that ſtops his ear, and refuſes to hear, Charm the Charmer never ſo wiſely,</hi> Pſal. 58.5. Some ſay of the Adder that ſhe is deaf on one Ear, and ſtops the other to prevent charming: others ſay that ſhe lays one Eare cloſe to the earth, and ſtops the other with her Tayl.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:170260:85"/>
                  <p>It is true thou canſt not heare. But what is the Reaſon of it? is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt ſtopped thine eare; And thou canſt not ſee; but is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wilt not? thou haſt ſhut thine eyes. But wil this be a good plea?</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable that two Evangeliſts quoting that paſſage in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Chap. 6.9. The one ſays, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.40. <hi>They could not becauſe he had blinded their eyes,</hi> &amp;c. But another gives the reaſon of it from their unwillingneſs to imbrace the truth <hi>Math.</hi> 13.14, 15. <hi>For their eyes they have cloſed</hi> &amp;c. So that laying both together, It is plain, that ſometimes men cannot becauſe they will not: ſometimes againe they cannot, becauſe God ſays they ſhall not. But the ſecond is a puniſhment for the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre I have ſhewn you what kinde of Natural abilities this doctrine ſuppoſeth in the Creature; I ſhal adde a few things to ſhew you what kinde of freedome it ſuppoſeth in the wil.</p>
                  <p>It ſuppoſeth that the Lord leaves the Will free, I mean the wil of the Naturall man <hi>(i.e.)</hi> he dos not determine or incline them to Evill, but leaves them to their own choice, whether it be of good or evill, of life or death, light or darkneſs.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170260:85"/>if he ſhould move them to Evil, that could not be true of the Apoſtle, <hi>James</hi> 1.13. <hi>God tempteth no man to evil.</hi> Therefore the Lord tels <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he had ſet life and death before them, that they might chooſe one. And the reaſon why men do not chooſe life when it is ſet before them rather then death, is not becauſe the wil is not free, but becauſe it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and depraved; For without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie the Wil is ſo farre free, that what ever a man wills or chooſes, he does it freely, the will cannot be forc'd. But let me not be miſtaken here, as if I were pleading for that which ſome do make to be the liberty of the Wil. They would have the Wil of man to be free from corruption, and void of Enmity to God and his ways, and to ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different betwixt good and evil. Now I do not ſay that the Wil of man is not corrupted; but I ſay that the Wil hath an Eſſential Freedome; and this may very wel be; for it may be more prone to Evil then to good through corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet looſe none of its Eſſential Liberty.</p>
                  <p>Conſider therefore the Freedom of the Wil does not conſiſt in an indifferency to good or evil, as ſome would have
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170260:86"/>it, who place the Will of man Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwixt theſe two without any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to one more then to another. And indeed, they who lay the whole weight of Salvation upon the Will of the Creature, muſt prove this, or they prove nothing: For if mans Salvation does depend wholly upon his will, as to the perfecting of it, and that Wil be by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed by Natural Corruption, there is great and eminent danger of ſuch a mans miſcarrying. But although the Wil be left free, and not determined to Evil by the Lord, yet I ſhal ſhew you that there is no ſuch freedom of Wil as many men dream of, <hi>viz.</hi> Never any man did ſtand equally poyſed betwixt good and evil.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Dem. <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency had freedom of Wil, if ever any had it, yet he did not ſtand thus at an indifferency betwixt good or evil. But with the liberty of his Wil he had a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclination to good. He had a holy diſpoſition to good, yet withal a power to chooſe the contrary. And this incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to good, was of the perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Wil. But if the freedom: of the Wil did conſiſt in an indifferency to good or evil, then it muſt follow, Either that <hi>Adam</hi> had not a free Wil, or
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170260:86"/>that <hi>Adam</hi> had not the Image of God. For ſuch an indifferency to good or evil, could not conſiſt with the Image of God. For wherein was he like to God, if not in his Wil? And if that were inclined no more to good then evil, wherein was he like to God? ſurely he ſtood inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to good, although not unchangably; ſo that although there was a holy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in <hi>Adams</hi> heart to good, yet this did not take away the freedom of it; he willed good the more freely; and for evil he had a liberty to chooſe it, as he did being tempted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Man in his fallen eſtate hath not ſuch a kinde of freedome of Wil as conſiſteth in the indifferency of it to good or evil. For beſides the liberty of his wil, there is corruption in it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining and byaſſing it to Evil, which yet he freely wils. And that there is ſuch corruption in the wil of man, is plaine, in that the Scripture excuſes no part, and principally it charges corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the VVil. Nay to ſhew how much the VVil is inclinable to Evil, he cals the Luſts of men the VVils of the fleſh and of the minde, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that ſuch abominations as they have lived in, had their riſe principally
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170260:87"/>from the corruption of the Wil, which did lead to ſuch things. Hence I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is that evil things are called our own things, and the ways of ſin our own wayes, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. <hi>He ſuffered all Nations to walk in their own wayes,</hi> (i. e.) in wayes of ſin and vanity. Hence alſo the Luſts and looſe practices of the Gentiles are called the <hi>Will of the Gentiles,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. To ſhew that their very hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were in ſuch ways and works, and that what they did was not ſo much from any thing without, as from the ſtrong and ſteady bent of their own Wils: Nay the Apoſtle to ſhew more fully the corruption of the Wil, makes but one wil betwixt carnal men and the devil, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. Compare the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe with the third. He ſayes in one, <hi>they walked according to the courſe or inclination of the World,</hi> and in the other he ſays, <hi>they walked according to the Prince of the powers of the Ayre;</hi> They fulfilled the Wil of the devil and their own at once; And indeed Natural men do incline to evil as he does, only their wils are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable and may bow towards God, but his is unchangably fixed on evil: ſo that by this it appears the natural man hath no ſuch freedom or liberty of Will as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170260:87"/>as was mentioned. God hath left it free, but his own corruption hath not left it indifferent to good or evil, but ſtrongly inclines it to the latter: And if the natural man ſtood in ſuch an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to good or evil, it is very ſtrange that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould ſpeak ſo of the whole lump of Mankinde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>There is none that ſeeketh after God: there is none that doth Good, no not one.</hi> It is ſtrange that none ſhould chooſe the right way, if they ſtood all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ſee the renewed man ſtands not in ſuch an indifferency; For grace which does not deſtroy the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the wil, inclines it to Good. We find that the wil renewed is the very ſeat of Grace and holineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>To will is preſent.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle ſays, <hi>With my mind I ſerve the Law of God.</hi> Surely by his minde he properly means his will: that was ſtrongly moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and he could ſee grace there, although he could ſee it no where elſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>In my body dwells no good thing</hi> Saints ſee grace in their wils, which doth ſupport them againſt the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they ſee in every part beſide. And by the Rule of Contraries, if grace
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170260:88"/>be moſt in the Regenerate Wil, Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſt in the Unregenerate Will; but this the Natural man wil not take notice of. so that its manifeſt that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Man in Innocency, in his fallen, and in his renewed ſtate, had liberty in their Wils, yet none of them had that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which conſiſted in an indifferency to good or evil.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to chuſe good or evil, but he was diſpoſed and inclined to good. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. <hi>God made man upright.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Man fallen chuſes evil ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>The thoughts of his heart are evil, only evil, and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Man in his renewed ſtate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he hath a corrupt part in him, yet he is more inclinable to good then evil. His Wil is principally for God. So that theſe things conſidered, we may Conclude that a Mans Cannot is from his Corruption. And if <hi>Paul</hi> complained of a Cannot, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. when yet his Will was not indifferent but manifeſtly inclining to good; ſurely we do Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Natural man no wrong to ſay of him, that he cannot, becauſe of his Corruption which does ſtrongly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170260:88"/>his Wil to evil. It is ſtrange that Saints complain of a Cannot, who have grace in their Wills, and yet many will not allow ſuch a Cannot in the Natural man, who hath nothing but Corruption in his Wil.</p>
                  <p>Having now ſhewn you theſe things, there lies another ſcruple to be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which is this; Does God go ſo far as hath been hinted, to make a day of Grace for them that periſh, and have they all outward helps in common with them who are ſaved, and have they ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inward helps as have been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> Wherein does the work of God upon his Elect differ from his workings upon theſe whilſt their day continues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The difference lies principally in this; That al the movings and workings of God upon wicked men, are not upon their Wils to bring them over to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but they are upon their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, their Conſciences, and ſomtimes upon ſome of their affections. But the principal work of God upon his Elect is upon their Wils, they come over firſt and faſteſt unto God.</p>

Nay I wil ſhake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alſo, and that ſhal riſe againſt thee by way of conviction, thou ſhalt ſee the danger of thy eſtate in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>I</hi> wil break in upon thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; thou ſhalt find, not onely fears of hel and wrath to ſollicite thy return, but alſo ſome joyes in complying with my word and wayes. But as for thy will, <hi>I</hi> wil leave that to its freedome, let it chooſe what pleaſeth it beſt; now let it take life or death, they are both before it. And now if the wil were indifferent when Judgement and conſcience, and ſome of its affections are for Believing and Repenting, it would ſurely ſtrike in, and all theſe would engage and bring it over to Chriſt. But notwithſtanding all this, the Wil fals back, and chooſeth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſin, which pleaſes it beſt, becauſe of the corruption which is in it. So that whiles corruption remains in the Wil, it ſpues out this knowledg and theſe convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and runs on to folly, which it hath choſen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. <hi>They did not like to retaine the knowledge of God in their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170260:89"/>hearts.</hi> Whatever comes in to check the ſoul in the way of ſin, is an unwelcome gueſt, ſo long as the will remains cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and tainted, and the wil caſteth but the light of the underſtanding, and the convictions of conſcience, as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners do pump out the water which breaks in upon them. <hi>Balaam</hi> had a clear knowledg of the happineſs of the Saints, but his Wil was for Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Felix</hi> had a clear conviction of <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> but his wil was for his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and therefore he reſolves to ſtop the mouth of Conſcience by ſending <hi>Paul</hi> away. The wil deals with the light of truth as the ſore eye deals with the ſunne, ſhuts the window to keep it out becauſe it offends. <hi>John</hi> 3.17. <hi>Men love darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> They are ſet to do wickedly, and they reſolve to do it qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly.</p>
                  <p>But when God works upon his Elect, he begins with their wils, he ſets them at work, and when this begins, the whole man ſoon follows. For the wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all, it bids one go, and it goes; and another come and it comes; and though the Lord does thus work upon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170260:90"/>the Wil, yet he takes not away the liberty of it. But what the ſoul wills it wills freely, and his principall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing works lyes in theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he takes off the prejudice that was in the Wil, and that averſneſs which was in it to ſpirituall things. Before, Corruption did lead it againſt light and Convictions, now it is otherwiſe. This was the firſt work upon <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 9.4.5. Chriſt tooke off the prejudice he had againſt the wayes and people of Chriſt; <hi>why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> ſays Chriſt, theſe are my ways and my people. Then <hi>Paul</hi> cryes out, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have mee to doe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The prejudice of the Will being removed there is an eaſier and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer way opened to ſpiritual things, the ſoul ſees execllency now, where it ſaw none before; and ſo the underſtanding gets more light, and is the better able to guide the Will. How did <hi>Paul</hi> ſee the truth and Harmony of Scripture to prove Chriſt to be the Sonne of God when his prejudice againſt him was removed. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.22.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He does not only remove prejudice, and gives it more light, but
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170260:90"/>he does alſo ſweetly draw the Wil by a perſwaſive power: So that although it comes neceſſarily, yet it is freely. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays <hi>David,</hi> who had experienc'd this work of grace upon himſelf, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110.3. <hi>In the day of thy power thy people ſhal be willing.</hi> When God does manifeſt the power of Grace, it is moſtly to be ſeen in the Wils of his people. You have a manifeſt proof of this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19. <hi>After I was turned I Repented.</hi> And what was that turning, but ſuch a power as <hi>I</hi> have ſhewn you moving the wil. And he acknowledges his repentance to be a fruit of his turning to <hi>God,</hi> or rather of Gods turning him. VVhat is it that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prays for, is it no more then illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or conviction, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.36. <hi>Incline my heart unto thy teſtimonies.</hi> And what does the Spouſe pray for but this? <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Draw me and we wil run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee.</hi> Does ſhe pray onely for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral drawing? Surely no. She was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the excellency of Chriſt, and of following of him before, as is plaine by the 2d and 3d verſes. But ſhe prayes for more effectual grace in her wil, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed here lies the maine of the work of grace. For ſhould God let in never ſo much light and plaine Convictions,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170260:91"/>and yet ſuſpend his influence from the wil, that would hang behinde, and the ſoul would be left out of Heaven. It would be ſad with Gods people if things ſhould be left depending upon their wils, and their wils left to themſelves. And if there were no more but a Salvability or poſſibility for all men to be ſaved, and this did hang upon their wils em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing or not embracing the Truth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Liberty; then, although ſome would ſay, here is hopes that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man might be ſaved, yet there were a ſtronger probability, that no man might be ſaved. For this muſt be granted.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that as all have liberty to chooſe, ſo they have liberty to refuſe, and ſo may all be loſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are all corrupted, and very likely they may be byaſſed by that, and led aſide from the truth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are tempted, and it is Ten to one but this may turn the ſcale, if the Wil ſtand indifferent; it is a ſtrong probability that Corruption and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation together will weigh down the ſcale.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Satan prevailed over <hi>Adam</hi> when he had more grace then we, and none of thoſe corruptions which we
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170260:91"/>have; therefore he may prevaile over every particular man il he ſtand upon his termes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He often prevailes over the people of God againſt their wils, which are inclined to good, and by grace diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for it; How much more may he prevail over thoſe whoſe wils at beſt are but indifferent, but as hath been proved are corrupted.</p>
                  <p>But ſome wil ſay yet farther; if there be ſuch a difference betwixt the work of God upon the Elect and others, and God does afford that to one which he does not to another. <hi>Qu.</hi> How ſhal all men be left without excuſe? ſhal not thoſe that periſh have ſomewhat to ſay for themſelves, in as much as the Lord did not work upon them as he did upon others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No. Becauſe firſt he leaves them the caſting voice; he goes ſo farre with them until it comes to this, whether they wil believe and repent or not; it lies now upon the motion of their wils. If thy Wil did move Heavenward, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be ſaved; if it move otherways, thou art loſt. The main thing which ſtands betwixt thee and Heaven, is thy corrupt wil.</p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:170260:92"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Thou haſt as much from God to move thee to look Heavenward, as thou haſt from Satan to lead thee on in ſinne. For thou haſt light, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and many moral perſwaſions from the Lord, and thou haſt no more from Satan; He cannot force thee, he can but perſwade; and thus the Lord deals with thee many wayes Nay, thou ſeeſt oftentimes more reaſon to come off from the world, and thy Luſts, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt, then thou doeſt to continue in them, and yet thou goeſt againſt theſe perſwaſions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thou doeſt follow thy light in all things, except the things of thy ſoul, thy wil follows thy underſtanding in all carnal things, in profit, honour, and advantage, but it goes contrary to it in the things of thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thou canſt not plead thine inability, becauſe thou thinkeſt that thou haſt ability. Thou thinkeſt thou canſt Believe and Repent at pleaſure, yet thou doeſt not ſet about it, thtrefore thou art inexcuſable. As theſe <hi>Jews</hi> were, <hi>John</hi> 9.41. <hi>Becauſe you ſay you ſee your ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Thou abuſeſt ſo much power as proves that hadſt thou more thou
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170260:92"/>wouldeſt abuſe that alſo. He that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uſe that which he hath, would not uſe more if he had it. Therefore thy not having enough cannot excuſe thee. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.10. <hi>He that is unjuſt in a little is unjuſt in much.</hi> Therefore may it be ſaid of thee as it was of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.31. <hi>Neither would they Repent if one roſe from the dead.</hi> So may I ſay; if thy Wil be againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and Believing, if Angels ſhould come from Heaven, and the damned ſhould be ſent from hel to preach to thee, thou wouldeſt not believe.</p>
                  <p>Having diſpatcht theſe, <hi>I</hi> come now to the uſe of what hath been laid down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is it ſo then that men have a day, Then how juſtly wil God condemne ſuch Goſpel ſinners at the laſt day? God wil be juſtified when he ſpeaks, and cleere when he judges, but eſpecially when he deales with ſuch as obey not the Goſpel. If that Judgement ſhal be acknowledged juſt which ſhal paſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heathen, becauſe they did not walk up to the light of Nature, which was the only light they had. How much more wil thy ſentence be juſt, who doth not obey a light which is farre greater then this. Thou hadſt ſo much light as to make it day to thee when it was night
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170260:93"/>with them: You never heard that any mans Condition who lived not under the Goſpel, was called day, but night and darkneſs, as appears, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.16. It is ſayd the people ſate in great darkneſs before Chriſt came and preacht to them. And <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. They were called <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> But if they periſh who fall in the night, woe be unto thee if thou fall in the day. Conſider of this I beſeech you, all you who live under the Goſpel. What will you be able to ſay for your ſelves at the laſt day when Chriſt ſhall plead the caſe with you. When he ſhall point out ſome of you before men and Angels, and ſay, Behold theſe are the men and women that would have none of me, nor my wayes. Time was that I offerd them life and ſalvation, but they would not have it upon my Termes, but now they ſhall not have it upon any Termes. They choſe their Luſts before my wayes and Statutes, and now I wil chooſe their ruine and deſtruction. Theſe poore ſouls ſhal have that charge layd againſt them, which is brought in againſt <hi>Jezabel,</hi> Rev. 2.21. <hi>I gave them ſpace to Repent, and they Repented not:</hi> And what anſwer can be given to this? Will it not fall heavy when the Lord
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170260:93"/>ſhal ſay; You cannot ſay that I tooke the firſt advantage againſt you. No, I waited long, and you had your time, you were not gathered untill your iniquities were ful ripe, through my patience, and your perverſneſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if all theſe poore wretches ſhould joyn together to petition for one drop of mercy, it would not be granted unto them; If they ſhould lift up their voices together, and wept bitterly as <hi>Eſau</hi> did for the bleſſing, yet they ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, becauſe they come too late. Such ſoules ſhal be more miſerable then <hi>Eſau</hi> was for although he came too late, and the chief bleſſing was gone, yet he had a leſſer inſtead of the greater. But theſe who wil not have it when it is offered, ſhal not onely loſe the bleſſing, but ſhal be curſt inſtead of being bleſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed.</hi> And what can be more juſt then this, that they who would not receive the bleſſing when it was offered them, ſhould now have a curſe inſtead of a Bleſſing? And what a Gall wil this be to their hearts to conſider how much they have loſt for how little, and what fooles they were to neglect that bleſſedneſs which is now loſt, but did once lye at their feet. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170260:94"/>every condemned ſinner ſhall be ſent to Hel convinc'd of the Juſtice of the ſentence under which he lies, yet none ſhal go with ſuch ſhame and confuſion to Hell, as thoſe who have had ſuch a day as hath been declared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. If there be ſuch a day, and thy ſalvation depend upon thy cloſing with the Goſpel, and the offers of it, or thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of it. Then let not your heads be ſo much buſied about thoſe things which when thou haſt found out thou maieſt be damned. Thou pretendeſt that thou art much buſied about enquiring whether Chriſt died for all or not, and that this is a point of ſuch concernment that thou canſt not beleeve unleſſe thou art ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about it. Alas when thou haſt gotten the greateſt ſatisfaction that may be, thou art as far from Heaven as now, and thou maieſt periſh notwithſtanding. For if thou believeſt not, if thou art not regenerated and born again, whether he died for thee, or not, thouſhalt bee damned. It were more profitable abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly for thee to ſpend that time which hath been ſpent in this ſtudy in inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after the terms of the Goſpel. Study Faith and Repentance, Self-denial, and the taking up of the Croſſe, Go and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170260:94"/>learn what the meaning of this is; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man be born again bee cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> I remember there were ſome who came to Chriſt with ſuch a queſtion as this, and although it were not altogether uſeleſs, yet becauſe it might have been more practical, hee ſlighted it, and them that brought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. <hi>Are there few</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Chriſt would not anſwer this, leſt he ſhould give them encouragement to multiply needleſs que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to him: But he adviſes them to <hi>Enter in at the ſtreight gate.</hi> It were better to be labouring to get in our ſelves, then to be buſie to know how few or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhal go in, when it wil be all one to us whether they be more or leſs, if we be excluded.</p>
                  <p>Thus again many will buſie their heads more about pleading out the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Natural man in the things of God, then they do in employing and improving what they have for God. It were doubtleſſe much better for thee to ſpend thy time in the improvement of thy abilities for God, and for thy Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good, whether they be more or leſſe, and in praying for an increaſe of them, then to vindicate and maintain that to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170260:95"/>be great which thou makeſt little uſe of. For whether thy abilities be more or leſs, yet if they be neglected, thou ſhalt periſh with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. If there be ſuch a day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then complaine not for want of power until thou haſt been ſenſible of, and mourned over the want of a wil; for this is the firſt and principal want of the ſoul. It is true, A man in his Natural Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does want power, yet it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that he wants, but he rather wants a wil; for he hath power to do more then he wil, it cannot be ſaid that want of power ſtops him, becauſe he goes not to the end of that which he hath; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot complain juſtly and ſay I cannot, unleſſe he were come ſo farre as he can. VVhen thou art gone ſo far as thou canſt poſſibly, then thou mayeſt complaine of thy Cannot; And it may be a good plea. But whilſt thou mayſt go farther, do not complaine of thy Cannot; it is thy Wil not which holds thee back. Thoſe complaints are but excuſes, and God wil ſo caſt them back upon thy teeth at laſt. Thou ſayeſt as the ſluggard did who is not minded to leave his bed, <hi>I cannot go, there is a Lyon in the way;</hi> But how does he know what is in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170260:95"/>the way when he lyes in his bed? ſo ſayſt thou <hi>I</hi> cannot, but thou doeſt not try whether thou canſt or not. Thou doeſt not attempt it, or at leaſt very careleſſy. The plain Engliſh of this is, thou wilt not; yet thou deceiveſt tby ſelf by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining thus of thine inability, and wouldeſt have thy wil excuſed, as if there were no fault in it.</p>
                  <p>VVicked men have gotten a trick to ſteale the complaints of Gods people, and they take them into their mouths very improperly. For although the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God who have wils to do more then they can, may complain properly of their cannot, yet this belongs not to thee; for thou canſt do more then thou wilt. Complaints of inability do ſit the mouths of none but the people of God, becauſe it is not the want of VVil, but of power vvhich ſtops them. Therefore they can ſay; Lord we would be more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and more holy, we would do more then we do, but we cannot. God hath diſcovered unto them the corruption of their VVils in their former eſtate, and hath humbled them for it, and he hath ſhewed them how far they did fal ſhort of their abilities formerly, and laid them in the duſt for it, and now the ſtream of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170260:96"/>their wils is turned, and they run out infinitely after God. But for thy part thou wert never humbled for the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of thy VVil, thou art not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit to complain of a cannot. How canſt thou without ſhame complaine for want of power, when thou haſt not gone to the end of what thou haſt. Go and learn what it is to be humbled for want of a vvil for God, and vvhen thou haſt mourned for want of this, then thou mayſt next be pitied vvhen thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt for vvant of power, but until thou haſt uſed all meanes in thy power, and reach, thou haſt no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a Cannot; but vvhen thou haſt done this, then thou mayeſt take up this complaint; <hi>Lord, thou haſt commanded me to do thus, and thus, but I cannot.</hi> Behold I have ſed the meanes, it ſticks not at my VVil, for I have given al diligence, but it ſticks for vvant of power. Lord I vvould if I could.</p>
                  <p>This is intimated in that Plea which <hi>Paul</hi> makes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>How to perform that which is good I finde not;</hi> As if he would ſay, I do not plead a Cannot for excuſe, for it is not an idle one. Though I cannot do what good I would, yet I am not content with willing it,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170260:96"/>but I am ſeeking to do it, but I finde not to do it, though I enquire after it with al diligence. Saints do not fail of the good they would do for want of Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, but thou ceaſeſt from endeavours and pleadeſt a Cannot, before thou haſt uſed this. Thy plea is a miſtake, and there is a deluſion in it; it fits not thy mouth, go thy way home, and ſtudy thy wil not, and mourn over that; but leave this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to thoſe to whom of right it doth belong.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. If there be ſuch a day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to improve thy abilities without truſting to them; ſtrive, as knowing that without ſtriving thou ſhalt not be ſaved, and yet look unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> as having done nothing thy ſelf. Caſt away all ſelfe-confidence. Runne, for he that runneth not ſhal not obtaine, yet look for all from free grace, knowing <hi>it is not he that willeth, nor he that runneth, but God that ſheweth mercy, Rom.</hi> 9.16. If thou doeſt periſh, it is through thy own default, becauſe thou doſt not what thou mayſt: But if thou art ſaved, it is not for any thing wrought by thee, but for the free mercy of God in Chriſt. This is a great <hi>myſtery</hi> to man, he cannot tel how to act in the way of ſalvation without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170260:97"/>upon what he does. If it be not (ſays he) in my power to Beleeve and repent, why ſhould I act? And if it be in my power, why do you adviſe me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny my abilities? Hence come two great miſcarriages amongſt men: They run into the extream on either hand. Some have ſuch high opinions of the abilities of the Creature, and take the work of ſalvation to be ſo much in the hand of Man, that they know not how to deny themſelves in their own actings and wiſdome in ſpiritual things. They give God the honour of putting them into a poſſibility of being ſaved; But they take the honour of perfecting their ſalvation to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Others lay the work ſo upon God, that they excuſe themſelves from doing any thing. Alas (ſay they) we are weak, and what can we do? If he will convert us, we ſhal be converted: Theſe wil not know the Doctrine of Duty. There are few that wil bring the Doctrin of ſelf-denial and duty together; That wil work and yet deny their works; expect God in a way of ſtriving, and yet not reſt upon indeavours. But to theſe I ſay, Although you cannot do enough to ſave you, yet you may omit enough
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170260:97"/>to damn you. Therefore improve your abilities, leſt ye periſh for neglecting them.</p>
                  <p>To you who rely upon your own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, I ſay, The denying of your own abilities wil do you no harm; for eſteeming of them as little, does not make them leſſe; but going out of your ſelves to God may make them more. I ſay in a word to all, You have a day. If in this day thou doeſt not lay hold of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, thou ſhalt be damned becauſe thou wouldeſt not. But if in this time thou doeſt embrace the terms of Chriſt, and lay hold on peace, it is not becauſe thou wouldeſt, but becauſe he would. He did ſtir up thy will and abilities, and did give in freſh ſupplies, or elſe thou hadſt periſhed. Let therefore what you have heard of the abilities of the Natural man provoke you to go as far as it is poſſible for ſuch a one to go; and let that which you have heard of his inability keep you humble, and teach you to cry after Chriſt in the language of that poor man, <hi>Lord help my unbelief.</hi> Join ſelf-denial to all indeavours, be active and humble, Conſcientious to uſe all that thou haſt for God and thy ſoul, and yet look upon all as being nothing, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170260:98"/>then thou haſt learned this truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. If ſo. Then let all the people of God admire his diſtinguiſhing grace, who hath not only extended his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but his ſpecial mercy to them. He hath given others enough to leave them inexcuſable, and enough to aggravate their Condemnation, but he hath given you enough to convert you. It was mercy that God gave others the Goſpel, and the offers of it, But what mercy is it that he hath inclined your hearts to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſame being offerd? He gave them a day to ſeek, but he ſet this day apart to ſeek thee. He ſet life and death before them, and left it to them to chuſe. But the Lord himſelf choſe for thee the better part. He wrought upon their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings or conſciences, but he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon thy Wil. He gave thee a Wil to thy power, yea and beyond it, who hadſt abilities before beyond thy Wil. Here lies the great differencing work of grace which thou maieſt never forget: He wrought in thee to Wil and to do of his good pleaſure. So that although they who obeyed not the Goſpel were condemned through their own Wils, yet thou wert ſaved through the good
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170260:98"/>pleaſure and Wil of God, who made thee willing in the day of his power. Who hath made thee to differ? Is it not the Lord? oh take heed of diminiſhing the grace of God. When thou denieſt the diſtinguiſhing acts of it, you do eclipſe the Glory of it. So much as you take from the Corruption of the Wil, ſo much you take from the eminency of grace. Let thoſe who pretend to Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration bleſs the Lord, not as having received grace in Common with others, but as having received grace in ſpecial above others. Even as they did, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. They bleſs the Lord for redeeming them out of the tongues, and out of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That God vouchſafed more to them then to thoſe amongſt whom they lived. Oh you may ſay, It was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that God offerd us Heaven upon any terms; and if he had gone no further, it had been enough to convince us that he was gracious. Oh but he hath given us what he never gave them, <hi>viz.</hi> hearts to believe and cloſe with his gracious tenders, or elſe we had withſtood them alſo. He gave them the Law, but he put it in our hearts, all our deſires after grace are from his ſuperabounding grace, and what we are more then others, that we
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170260:99"/>are from what God did vouchſafe unto us more then unto them. It is not from the improvement of the ſame Talents and means which he had with others, nor from a Compliance with that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goſpel grace which was given to them and us; But it was from additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mercy; this was diſtinguiſhing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; 'Tis by this grace that we are what we are. So we can ſay as the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. Although we know God, yet it is more proper to ſay <hi>we are known of God.</hi> Therefore let him have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his own work upon your hearts, in converting and turning them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; let the work be acknowledged his from the beginning to the end of it; look on him as the author and finiſher of your faith. If God hath moved thy heart towards himſelf, and hath met thy endeavours with ſucceſſe, and thou art able in thy experience to ſay, it is good to draw nigh to God, take heed of ſetting up an high opinion of thine own free Will, as if that had moved God, rather then God had moved it; as if what thou haſt were rather the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of improved Abilities, then the fruits of Gods diſtinguiſhing Grace. If ever you would honour free grace, keep
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170260:99"/>up in thy heart a deep ſenſe of its diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing acts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 6. If it be thus, Then above all things look to your Wills, and try them whether they be ſet for heaven and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or not; And in purſuing this minde theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Get a thorow ſenſe of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of thy Will naturally and of its indiſpoſition to Good. For want of the knowledge of the malignity of the will cauſes deepe ſecurity amongſt many; they think their hearts are as good as any, when indeed the reaſon why they account them good, is becauſe they did never yet ſtudy the evil of them; and many poore ſouls goe blinded to Hell with the Good opinion of their own Wills.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Goe to the Lord and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him to take the worke into his hand; if the buſineſs of thy Salvation be left upon the motion of thy Will, thou are loſt. Tell him that thou haſt found which way the Wil of man does natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bend, and if he ſhould leave thy Will to it ſelfe thou art likely to make the ſame choyce that others have done who have been ſo left. Tell him, thou haſt ſo much Experience of the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170260:100"/>of thy Will, that thou dareſt not truſt it, nor venture thy Eternal intereſt upon it. And whereas others diſpute to get the work into their hands, do thou pray as hard to get it into the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Above all things beg a Will of him. Pray earneſtly that he would not only put forth his power in Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and bare Convictions, but that he would reveale this power in bringing over thy Will to himſelfe. Plead out this above all, that he would Convert thee that thou mayſt be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that he would Incline thy Will unto his Teſtimonies, and that he would draw thee that thou mayſt run after him. And tell him often, that thou ſtanded in need of nothing more then a Will for him, and if this be not given in thou art loſt. Follow the Lord with continuall complaints againſt the Corruption of thy Will, and never leave him till he ſet up his Image in that, till he hath bowed that to his Commands, and when thou canſt ſay, his Will is thine, and thy Will is his, then thou art a happy Man or Woman.</p>
                  <p>Application of the ſecond Doctrine.</p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:170260:100"/>
                  <p>This day is not meaſured by the length of our lives, but the meanes outward or inward.</p>
                  <p>Learne hence that there is more hopes of a people although ignorant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane to whom the Goſpel is coming, then of thoſe who are more knowing, from whom the Goſpel is departing. Gods withdrawing of publick meanes &amp; helps of this nature ſpeake his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt a people eminently, and tel us plainly that there is but little hopes of ſuch. When the Goſpel is coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dark ignorant prophane place, and declares that God hath a people there, &amp; the day is dawning to them. But when it is going away from a people. It either argues that God hath no people there, or none more to gather, or that his work is almoſt done. It argues that the Goſpel hath been abuſed or ſlighted, and that the day of grace is drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peace to an end to ſuch a people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it in forms us that they who live unprofitably under meanes are in a farre worſe condition then thoſe who live without meanes. There was more hopes of the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gtree although it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170260:101"/>before it was dreſt, then there was afterwards: Before it was dreſſed the keeper of the Vineyard was in hope that if it were digged it would bear fruit, but when the means was uſed, and no good comes of it, it leaves him hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus when we ſee men wicked and prophane, who live without the Goſpel, we ſay, oh if God would vouchſafe theſe poor ſouls the Goſpel, there were hopes of them: But we know not what to ſay, nor how to hope comfortably concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who continue the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they were, notwithſtanding the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel which is vouchſafed them: There is more hopes of a drunkard and ſwearer in the dark Corners, where they have not the light of the Goſpel, then there is of ſuch who continue in theſe things in the very light of the Goſpel. For there is hope of the drunkard and ſwearer who hath lived in darkneſs, that his day is not yet begun, and that God may give a day yet. But we fear that many of you who continue drunkards and ſwearers, &amp;c. have paſt your day, that is, worn out, and yet your ſouls are not healed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, See here a ſad miſtake under
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170260:101"/>which many poor ſouls do lie. Some there are upon whoſe hearts the word of God hath made ſome impreſſions, and they have been under ſome Convictions of Conſcience, and they have had ſome trouble for ſin, and ſome fears about their Eternal ſtate: But theſe convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are now abated, and their trouble for ſin grows leſſe and leſſe, and they come into a calm they know not how, and they bleſſe themſelves in this, as if things were much better then they were. But alas they ſee not that this is the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up their day, or of their eyes; they are now quiet indeed, and can ſin with leſſe trouble then formerly; the Word comes not near them, and Conſcience holds her peace; but this is a miſerable ſign of a declining ſoul; look to it you who meaſure the goodneſſe of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by the quietneſs and calmneſs of it, not by your experience of the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. Conſider that all things were in peace and quiet whilſt the ſtrong man kept the houſe, and that ſtrong man is the Divel; when Chriſt came and knock'd at the door of thy Conſcience it made ſome diſturbance, and the Divel began to buſtle and make a noiſe, but ſo ſoon
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170260:102"/>as Chriſt withdraws, he lies down in his place again, ſeeing all things ſafe; as you know if you come to a houſe in the night and knock at the doors, the Doggs wil bark, but when the noiſe is over, and they perceive you are gone, they wil lie down in their kennels again; ſo is it in this caſe, when Chriſt comes neer unto thee, and knocks by convictions, and thou art awakened, and ſeemeſt to offer at the ways of Chriſt, and makeſt a ſhew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, then he roars upon thee and troubles thee; but if he ſee that thou art willing to lie ſtil, and Chriſt withdraw, then Satan wil be quiet alſo, and ſo thy convictions ceaſe; conſider (you that bleſs your ſelves in the ceſſation of convictions and checks of conſcience) that the night is the ſtilleſt and moſt ſilent time, but it is the darkeſt; So may this time of quiet be the night of thy ſoul, when the former time of thy conviction was thy day. And doſt thou rejoyce that thy day is gone, and that night is come upon thee? oh if thou didſt but know what thou haſt loſt in looſing a faithful convincing conſcience, thou wouldeſt rather ſit down and mourn over thy loſs, then rejoice in thy peace; ſin prevails over thee and thou art quiet,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170260:102"/>the word ſmites and thou feeleſt it not, duties are neglected and thou art not troubled; oh is this a peace to bleſs thy ſelf in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> art thou joyful becauſe quiet? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou haſt little cauſe.</p>
                  <p>But you wil ſay; Is it not our duty to rejoice in the peace of conſcience? and do not the people of God do ſo?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is one thing to have peace of conſcience, and another thing to have quiet of conſcience: An enemy comes and appears before a city, and gives it an alarum, and perhaps he withdraws with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtorming of it. Upon the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the enemy there is quiet, they are freed from the fears of a preſent ſtorm; but there is no peace concluded betwixt them, and the enemy perhaps is but withdrawn to thy loſſe. If they had come to a treaty and Articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been drawn up, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had departed upon theſe, then they might have rejoyced in their peace: but a wiſe man wil not ſay ſuch an enemy is at peace with us; onely they are quiet for the time: but there is no cauſe to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure concerning ſuch a one ſo long as an enemy; perhaps he is but ſtepped back to take a better advantage, as we find he did
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170260:103"/>with Chriſt, he left tempting of him, that he might tempt him the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſſy. Oh therefore enquire whether your quiet calm eſtate ariſe from the ſlumbring conſcience, or from the treaty with it, and agreement; Has it been har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to, and anſwered, and pacified. An enemy may ſleep ſometimes in his Tent, and he makes no noiſe, not becauſe he is reconciled, but becauſe he is aſleep, yet a ſleeping enemy is an enemy, and thou mayſt know it when he awakes, that it had been better that he had been kept waking; if thy quiet be from the ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy conſcience, not from the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of it, thou ſhalt find it had been better it had never ſlumbered, that it wil awake like a Gyant, and ſet upon thee with ſo much the more fierceneſs. It is one thing to have troubles of conſcience removed by ſatisfying the conſcience, and another thing to have them removed by ſearing the Conſcience. A man is in a Lethargie, and he lies ſtil and feels no paine, he complains not, but his friends ſtand weeping about him, becauſe they know not whether he wil awake again or not; but they weep not over one that is in a ſleep, becauſe they know that reſt
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170260:103"/>is ſweet, but the other dangerous, and often deadly: Thus the caſe is with thee. Thou art now quiet, and Conſcience ſmites thee not, thou complaineſt not; oh but thy godly friends and relations mourn over thee, they ſtand by thee as a dying man. Oh ſays one, I had hopes of my Husband, or my Wife, or my child, or my friend; he or ſhe was under ſome Convictions for ſin, and it ſeemed to me his eyes began to open, and he ſtrugled for life; I ſaw an outward change for a time, and <hi>I</hi> hoped it would be a real ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual work, but oh my hopes are almoſt dead, I ſee that conſcience begins to be quiet, and he begins to be careleſs, and ſee how he is by little and little ſliding back into his former wayes; oh I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid he wil fal into a ſpirit of ſlumber, and go to hel in it. I had abundantly more hopes of his condition when he had leſſe.</p>
                  <p>But theſe very ſouls which mourn over thee, rejoyce to ſee another ſoul quiet: they are glad to hear of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts with which God hath comforted ſome poor doubting ſouls, becauſe they ſee that ſuch ſouls came by their peace in another way. Their peace is like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170260:104"/>ſleep to the body, it refreſhes their ſouls, and they are the ſtronger and the more lively for God, but thine is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and ſpends and weakens it. God hath given them peace by ſprinkling their conſciences with the blood of Chriſt. But thy peace is from the hardneſs and inſenſibleneſs of it, thou art almoſt paſt feeling.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is one thing to meaſure our condition by our peace, and another thing to meaſure it by the ſoundneſs of this peace. A carnal and wicked man meaſures his condition by the preſence or abſence of peace and trouble; If his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be troubled, and there be any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made for ſin, he judges that condition ſad, and he labours all wayes poſſible to take off ſuch trouble. As <hi>Felix,</hi> as ſoon as ever the word made him trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he ſends away <hi>Paul</hi> that he might be quiet. Becauſe he does not ſee the good which may follow ſuch a trouble. But a gratious heart counts his condition the better for ſuch troubles at firſt, and counts it a mercy that God would any way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken him, and although he lie under many fears, yet he expects much good from ſuch troubles, and would not be rid
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170260:104"/>of them, but upon good grounds: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he doth pray conſtantly to be delivered from thoſe troubles, yet he would not have been without them for the world, neither would he go back to his former condition, though he were ſure thereby to be rid of his troubles.</p>
                  <p>Again, when a gratious ſoul doth get peace, he doth not content himſelf bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with peace, but he examines what manner of peace he hath gotten; whether it be a holy place yea or no, whether it be better then his trouble; for, ſays he, although I wanted peace, and I ſought for that, yet the Lord-knows that was not all <hi>I</hi> ſought for. I ſought for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for communion with God, and f I know my heart. <hi>I</hi> had rather be kept without peace in my ſpirit, and yet cloſe to God, then come neerer to peace and to go farther off from God. Therefore unleſs he can ſee his peace is a holy gratious peace, accompanied with the fruits of the ſpirit, and with communion with God, it wil not pleaſe him; but if the heart be carnal under trouble, it is careleſs under a calm, and ſo it hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the ſtorm it is enough. It is a miſtake therefore when you ſay that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170260:105"/>the people of God do meaſure their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions by the peaceableneſs of it. No no, they meaſure it by the goodneſs and ſoundneſs of the peace that they have, and they ſuſpend their joy til they have proved and tryed their peace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You miſtake the peace of the ſoul; for it does not conſiſt in a freedom from conviction of ſin, nor in a ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tenderneſs of conſcience, and a loſſe of the ſenſe of the evil of it. But it lies in the evidence of the pardon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſin, which is ſpoken in to the conſcience, by which it anſwers all objections that are brought againſt it. For the people of God, who have moſt of this peace, have all theſe things yet remaining; Their peace ſtands with all theſe, but thine is built upon the abſence and want of theſe. As firſt, a gracious heart hath peace, yet it hath convictions of ſin. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we ſay we have n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſin,</hi> &amp;. Nay he hath more convictions of ſin then before, he ſees more ſinne in himſelf then ever he ſaw in all his life. <hi>Job</hi> 42.5, 6. <hi>I have ſeene the Lord, I abhorre my ſelf;</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.63. <hi>You ſhall be aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, when I am pacified towards you.</hi> Yes this does not break his peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170260:105"/>he ſees ſinne and pardon together, and the peace does not leſſen the ſight of ſin, but makes it plainer to him. But your peace is onely in the ceſſation of Convictions; you ſee not ſin as you did, and therefore you are not troubled; if thine eyes were open, and thou didſt ſee thy ſinne as the people of God do, it would revive thy troubles again. Thy peace is falſe, becauſe it conſiſteth not with conviction; if thou hadſt a true peace, it would heighten thy Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thou wouldeſt ſee more ſin then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet thou didſt, and thoſe more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which thou haſt ſeen already, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>When the Law came, ſin revived and I dyed.</hi> This is ſpoken of <hi>Paul</hi> after he had obtained the pardon of ſin; and he that before ſaw nothing blameworthy in him ſelf ſaw afterwards nothing but a body of ſin and death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſoul may be charged for ſin, and yet have peace. He may be charged by God as <hi>Iſrael</hi> is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. But this is to humble it. It may be charged by its own conſcience; as <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.18, 19. <hi>In my fleſh dwels no good thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He may be charged by Satan, as we
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170260:106"/>finde that he is ready to charge the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and tempt them to doubt of their intereſt. But yet the ſoul may have an anſwer to all theſe in the blood of Chriſt. A ſoul may have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that is alledged, peace with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. and ſtand out and ſay, though I am daily charged, and I cannot but charge my ſelf, <hi>yet who ſhall condemne? it is Chriſt that hath dyed.</hi> So that you ſee a Believers peace conſiſteth with theſe things. But thy peace is in this; Time was that thou wert troubled for ſinne, and thou couldeſt not eate or drink, or ſleep quietly for it, but now you thank God it is otherwiſe. God began to charge thee for ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was ſtirred, and thou wert a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and perhaps Satan began to charge thee too. For when God begins to charge for ſinne, to mind it of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. then the Devil he charges to drive the ſoul to deſpaire, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 18.12. And you ſhal ſee whether the hand of God or Satan be moſt in the trouble by theſe two things; whilſt the trouble continues; you ſhal know by obſerving whether the deſires after Chriſt, or the fears of wrath and hel are the greateſt;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170260:106"/>when the Trouble ends you ſhall know by the continuation of ſuch deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt. For if Gods hand be moſt In ſuch troubles for good, he will keep up the ſoul after himſelf when the trouble is over. But if Satans hand be principal in them, then they loſe all thoſe ſeeming deſires which they had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt. Oh you who have loſt your ſeeming zeal for God with your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of conſcience, Conſider, it is to be feared, that Satan onely troubled to keep thee off from Chriſt, he ſaw that God began to ſtir in the Word, and he thought it was time for him to ſtirr al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; But when he ſaw that God began to ceaſe ſtriving with thee, and thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſt to grow cold again, he ceaſed to trouble thee alſo, and hence is thy qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et: if Satan ſhould but ſtirre again, he would ſhake thy peace, and this he would do if he ſaw any danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thee, but he knows this peace is a likelier way to hold thee then ſuch a trouble; But Gods people have a peace in deſpite of all his moleſtations.</p>
                  <p>A believers peace does not deſtroy the tenderneſs of his conſcience, nor his ſenſibleneſs of the evil of ſin: for he is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170260:107"/>more ſenſible of ſin, then he was before; he ſees the evil of it more, though the danger be not ſo much. He is ſenſible of the ſmalleſt ſinne, and there is no ſin which he now does account ſo; when he was under terrours of Conſcience he looked upon his groſſe ſins, and his feares did ariſe principally from them, but now he looks upon his ſecret ſins, and his grief is for them. So that he ſaies when a temptation comes, how can I do this thing and ſinne againſt God?</p>
                  <p>But the carnal mans peace is much built upon his inſenſibleneſs, he ſees the evil of ſinne leſſe then he did, he feels Conſcience leſſe, and conſcience feels ſin leſſe; a little thing wil not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it now, and therefore he hath peace. But I tel you, this is a miſtaken peace which is built upon theſe things; For you ſee Gods people keep theſe, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſome of them as their peace is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed; But if thou hadſt not loſt theſe, thou hadſt not found peace; and it is a miſerable peace which is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the loſſe of the tenderneſs of the Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The people of God would
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170260:107"/>judge themſelves for the loſſe of their troubles, if experience were not left in the place of them: the freedome from trouble would trouble them; they would count it a very il change in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to change trouble for peace, if they could not experience another change with this in their ſouls. Such a ſoul would ſay, Time was that my conſcience was awakened, and <hi>I</hi> was ſenſible of ſinne, and when I did ſtep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide I was troubled, and I could not be at quiet for want of the evidences of Gods love, and of my eternal intereſt; but how is it now? there is a calme in my ſpirit; but if my condition be as bad as it was when <hi>I</hi> was firſt troubled, if my troubles be abated, if my condition be not altered, oh then my condition is much worſe; ſo much the worſe by how much the more quiet it is. But here is that ſtaies the ſouls of Gods people, and ſatisfies their ſpirits. Oh ſayes ſuch a one, I find bleſſed be God a change in my ſoul, ſutable to this change from trouble to peace. <hi>I</hi> find I was much troubled before for my ſins, But I was ignorant of Chriſt. But bleſſed be God he hath revealed him to me for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:170260:108"/>
                  <p>I did perform duty before, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in it, bleſſed be God for the change, I can do it now and deny it. <hi>I</hi> was troubled before for the neglect of duty, but <hi>I</hi> am now more grieved for the want of Gods preſence in a duty. When I was troubled before, I fled to my duties for eaſe, but now I go to the promiſes for it. I was troubled before becauſe I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>God</hi> in a covenant of works, but now I look upon him in a covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>I</hi> was troubled, then I lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my groſs ſinnes onely, but now I looke to my ſecret ſinnes, and I mourn over that which no eye ſees. I was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled becauſe I was afraid of hell, and I could apprehend no pardon for my ſin, but now I am troubled for ſin which I am ſure is pardoned. <hi>I</hi> was in much hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of conſcience, and I cried out I ſhal be damned, and my trouble made a noiſe, yet now <hi>I</hi> have another manner of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſin, it is as burthen ſome and a bitter to me as ever, and <hi>I</hi> hate it more then ever, and now <hi>I</hi> mourn for it, and melt away in the confuſion of my face under the diſcovery of Gods free pardon
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170260:108"/>of my ſinne. Whilſt <hi>I</hi> was in trouble, that kept me cloſe to duty, although it did not make me love the duty, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did it mortifie my corruption; But <hi>I</hi> find now that my peace kept me cloſe to duty alſo, yea and it makes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſweet to me, and it does carry me more after holineſs then my fears did. For then <hi>I</hi> did ſtudy ſo much reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as might ſerve to quiet my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but now <hi>I</hi> labour to be holy as <hi>God</hi> is holy, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.</p>
                  <p>Thus the gratious ſoul by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his preſent peace with his paſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, is comforted by the experience which is leſt inſtead of ſuch and ſuch troubles, under which it was formerly: And if it could find none of theſe, or ſuch as theſe, it would judge it ſelf for the loſſe of ſuch troubles, although thou doeſt bleſſe thy ſelf for this, that thy troubles are over, and all is quiet, but all this while thou haſt no experience of a change in thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Saints judge it better to be troubled for ſinne, then to walk qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in it; and they had rather want a little peace themſelves, then that ſinne
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170260:109"/>ſhould have too much: It is ſinne hath gotten peace, thou haſt none; ſinne hath leave to be quiet in thy ſoul. Thou wert troubled for thy drunkenneſs, thy ſwearing, or thy uncleanneſs, or thy ſcoffing, and thy Sabbath-breaking, and at the neglecting of duties; becauſe of theſe things Conſcience would not let thee be quiet; but now God hath ſayd to Conſcience, let him alone, he loves theſe ſinnes, though he pretends to be troubled for them, let him goe on, and enjoy them quietly; and now thou art a drunkard againe and quiet, a ſwearer and quiet, an unclean perſon and quiet, a Sabbth-breaker and quiet, thou layſt aſide duties, and yet are quiet; oh let me tel thee if the people of God were to chooſe, (although they would not be in thy Condition for a world) yet if they muſt chooſe one, they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be under thy former troubles, and thereby to be kept out of the Alehouſe, and thereby be kept to reading, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then have thy peace which opens a way to al thy former looſe practices againe. They judged thee in a better Condition, and had more hopes of thee when thou wert under trouble of ſpirit
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170260:109"/>and didſt make Conſcience of ſin, then now, that thou haſt a peace which gives thee liberty to ſin as in former times: The people of God would not have thy peace for the world.</p>
                  <p>Lay all theſe things together, and thou wilt eaſily ſee that thy peace is not to be joyed in, and although it be true that Gods people do account a quiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience a great mercy, yet it is not ſuch a quietneſs as thine is, neither is it a bare quietneſs which they rejoyce in, but the goodneſs of the Conſcience: But thine is ſuch a quietneſs as is a Curſe, and ariſes from a Judgement of God in blinding thine eyes, in hardning thine heart, and withdrawing all his Goſpel light from thee: There was a difference betwixt the people of God and thee in the time of trouble, and ſo there is a vaſt one now; when they were under trouble of Conſcience, yet they had a good Conſcience, although it were not quiet; now they have a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and quiet, ſo that is much better. Thou hadſt an evill Conſcience when it was troubled, it was but awakened, it was not ſanctified. But now it is quiet and evill, it is the worſe. For although
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170260:110"/>it were not then renewed, yet being inlightned it did performe its duty to thee in ſome meaſure, which now it neglects, and ſo thy latter end is like to be worſe then thy beginning. Therefore oh man or woman, who haſt conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it was better with thee then formerly becauſe thou art quieter, thou art under a ſad miſtake; for thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not growne better, but thine eyes are growne worſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the day end under means, oh then what reaſon is there to ſhake off ſecurity, and to give diligent heed leaſt any thing ſlip by us that we heare. Men are ready to ſay to the Word, as <hi>Felix</hi> did, Come another time: But it is a queſtion whether God will waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee any more or not; perhaps he'le give a Commiſſion to his Meſſengers to ſpeake no more, he will ſend them to another people. Or if it doe come againe, it may never come with that heat and light that it comes now to thee; the Word which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d Word ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to thee. <hi>Felix</hi> put off the Word when it came in ſome power; He might have heard many Sermons before he met with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170260:110"/>ſuch another. Oh let not the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of enjoying the meanes make thee ſecure under it. Thou ſayeſt pehapes, if thou wert likely to have no more of it, thou wouldeſt then liſten to the preſent word, and the Convictions of it. Oh but what if thou wert ſure yet to enjoy the Word, art thou ſure to finde it a Convincing Word? thou mayeſt have it then; but if God hath withdrawne the inlightning convincing power from it, what difference will there be betwixt thee and him that hath no word? oh how little is this conſidered and minded by the greateſt part of man! they hear as if they were ſure to heare againe, and as if there were no danger of being loſt under the Word; they ſay they have the meanes, and there is no ſuch haſt, if we here it not to day, we may hear it to morrow; we ſhall have the ſame Word then, which we have now, and it wil be well if we liſten to it then: But though you ſhould have the ſame Word, and the ſame perſons which ſpeake the Word to you then, yet you may finde it as another thing to you then; the Word may be now a Convincing Word, there may be ſome ſpirit and power in it
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170260:111"/>now, and then it may be otherwiſe to thee; God may have withdrawne all convincing quickning comforting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from it, and then it will ſeeme to thee that it is not the ſame Word that it was; thou mayſt hear the ſame things which ſtirre thee now, and not be moved at al, and then if God be withdrawne from his Ordinances, it is all one as if he had taken them away too.</p>
                  <p>Oh take this into your Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you who doe enjoy a conſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and have the Word conſtantly preacht to you, liſten to it as if it were departing from you; for though the Word it ſelf continue, yet if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit depart from it; thy ſoul is undone. If you had but a little time to live, or but a little time to hear the word, thou wouldeſt be perſwaded to look after it. But oh theſe may be true, one or both; but ſuppoſe neither be true, that thy life be not ſhort, nor the meanes ſhort, yet let me tell thee, the time in which God will ſtrive with thy ſoul may be ſhort, yea very ſhort. There is a prefixed time ſet for thee to come in to Chriſt, which if thou paſſeſt over, if thou diddeſt live to <hi>Methuſelabs</hi> age, and haddeſt the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170260:111"/>means under Heaven, yet thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not be converted. If thou haddeſt an aſſurance that any time in thy life would ſerve the turn, yet thou haſt no reaſon to delay; for thy life is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and ſhort for this great work: But the means is more uncertain; thou art not ſure that the Goſpel ſhal always ſound in thine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ars. Oh but Gods ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with thy heart is moſt uncertain; for who knows how ſoon he wil give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſtruggle with thee? Thy life is a very inconſiderable thing, becauſe of the ſhortneſs of it, it is but a moment in compariſon of eternity; Oh but the day of grace is a ſhort thing in compariſon of thy life. Take heed of careleſneſs, as if thou didſt know that thy day of grace would bold to the laſt day of thy life.</p>
                  <p>We never read that converſion and death met together in one day, ſave to one man, which was the Thief on the Croſſe; it was to one, to prevent deſpair in them whoſe eyes are then opened; and it was but to one, that none might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon ſuch a time before it come.</p>
                  <p>If ſuch a day, and it hath ſuch an end, and it leave men under ſuch an irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170260:112"/>condition, then take hold of the preſent time, while it is called to day; Becauſe thou art ſure onely of the preſent, there is a night coming when no man can work, not onely a night of death, but a night of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſlumber, wherein thou ſhalt walk up and down, with eyes blinded, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding darkened, affections aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God, Conſcience ſeared with a black mark of ruine and perdition, upon thy ſoul; when thou ſhalt not onely be without ſence, but paſt ſence, paſt ſeeing, and paſt feeling, and paſt hopes: when thou ſhalt think that thou ſeeſt, and yet ſeeſt not, and think that thou perceiveſt, and yet ſhalt be blinde as the Mole, having no true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of God, nor of thy own condition before him. Oh when this night comes upon thee, woe unto thee, thy work muſt needs lye behind for ever, If you could but foreſee ſuch a thing as this is, and did believe indeed that it would come upon thee, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou not lay aſide all delaies, and bethink thy ſelf of improving this inch of time which thou haſt for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:170260:112"/>
                  <p>I beſeech you all therefore in the Lord, be perſwaded to conſider of this thing, it is a great thing that I am trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about, lay it to your hearts, and lay about you as thoſe who have but a little time to mind a great buſineſs.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Think of theſe things.</head>
                     <p>Firſt, Some think themſelves too great to think on ſuch things, they have great cares and many incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Many think they are not great enough, when they are riſen to ſuch a height in honour or eſtate, then they wil mind it: and ſome too young, another time wil ſerve. All theſe put it off to another time. A death-bed, there they appoint Conſcience to meet them and debate the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Two great general Deceits run tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row mens hearts.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, They pretend that they wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Goſpel; Few will ſay in plaine termes, <hi>We wil not have Chriſt reign over us,</hi> or, <hi>We wil never hear any more of this matter,</hi> but they wil appoint another time, as they judge moſt convenient, not conſidering that the time they dreame
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170260:113"/>of, may not come at all, or if it does it may be no time for this; the time for this work may be paſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They act for the world, as if their being rich &amp; great did depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a day; but as if the buſineſs of their ſouls had no dependance on the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of time; but the Scripture ſpeaks otherwiſe, it has ſet thee a day for thy ſoul, which if thou neglect thou ſhalt loſe; but for the world, that may be had in the laſt place. <hi>Matthew</hi> 6. <hi>Firſt ſeek the kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> Great men, mind this, you have but a day, you may neglect the time, and God wil be as ſtrict with you as others in this, and you have many hindrances, and leſſe helps then others. <hi>Therefore not many rich,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To poor; you have a day too, although not to be rich and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet to be happy, if you neglect it not.</p>
                     <p>It is a word of exhortation to you al; to old ones, you have ſpent a great deal of time, and what proviſion have you made for Eternitie? If your day be not over, yet you cannot expect, that yours will laſt long, you cannot expect to enjoy many
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170260:113"/>daies in the fleſh, and if this be a truth which you have heard from the Word, you are in a great deal of danger, and it is high time for you to awake.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It ſpeaks alſo to you that are Young ones, and bleſs your ſelves in the prime of your daies, &amp; beginning of your ſtrength; it ſpeaks to you in that of the Wiſe-man, <hi>Ec.</hi> 12 1. <hi>Remember now thy Creator.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do not ſay, In my old Age, no, but do it in thy Youth; nor yet, I wil do it in my Youth, but not yet; but ſet about it now. I ſay to thee as Chriſt did to <hi>Judas, What thou doeſt, do it quickly.</hi> Do not ſay, Thy Years are but few yet, and thy daies are but begun; for ought thou knoweſt the day of Grace may be almoſt done, although the daies of thy life are but begun; this Goſpel-day is nearer to an end then thou art aware of: thou haſt no aſſurance of life, but much leſſe aſſurance of this; if You didſt believe this, how would it rouſe up your ſpirits, and provoke you to take heed of every opportunity for your ſouls?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If it be ſo, then take heed of ſlighting convictions, and the ſtruglings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for theſe are the critical times of your lives, then you are near to making or marring, now is the time or never.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170260:114"/>And although thou art called to be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous t all times, yet more eſpecially now thy eternal happineſſe lies at the ſtake; and when God begins to ſtruggle with thee, it will be ſeen in a ſhort time whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt be eternally happy or miſerable. This part of thy life is like to thoſe Critical days which Phyſitians obſerve, when either the Diſeaſe abates, and breaks, or kills: So now, either thou wilt grow better or worſe after this, either the day will break, and darkneſſe will fly away and ſcatter or elſe the night will begirt thee, and thy darkneſs will be much blacker then it was. Have a care therefore all you who come to the Ordinance and finde any ſtirrings upon your Conſciences, leſt you neglect this time.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe now God is near unto you, I may draw an exhortation out of the Apoſtles words, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27. Now feel after God if happily you may finde him, for he is not farre from you; he is now with you, and in you, by his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning and convincing power, now is the time if ever for ſuch a word to take place, as we have, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek him whiles he may bee found.</hi> If ever God were neare you in a way of mercy,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170260:114"/>it is now; he is not only near you by his Goſpel, but in it, he comes in it, and with it; he ſends the ſpirit with the Word, if thou doeſt flight theſe motions, thou mayeſt never find him ſo near thee; if he once go out of his Word and leave thee without a convincing light and power, he then will go further and further from you, and then wee may ſay, Woe to you, when God is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from you, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.12. This is one of the firſt ſteps of Gods forſaking Souls, when he forſakes the Word under which they ſit, and it is in order to that dreadfull ſentence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, &amp;c.</hi> O therefore as you would not hear that dreadfull Sentence then, fear it now; loſe God now, and thou art like to loſe him for ever; But if thou wouldeſt keep him now and poſſeſſe him then, ſo keep and cheriſh his Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: take heed of ſlighting theſe, for it is a ſlighting of God, and if thou ſlight him while he is near thee, thou wilt drive him further off quickly.</p>
                     <p>Be more careful now then ever, becauſe the day ſpends apace, it haſtens away more then ever; you know when the ſun comes
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170260:115"/>at the higheſt, he declines apace; when the days are at their length, they do ſhorten quickly, &amp; when it is noon, the ſun haſtens to his bed. This time of Gods ſtirring with thee by Conviction is as thy Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; if thou ſlight that, thy day will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline apace, it will not be long ere it be night, therefore while it is not only day, but noon-day, work; for there is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time betwixt Noon and Night. Nay let me tell thee, thy day of Grace is not like the Natural day, or year. You know that the ſun is as long deſcending as aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and therefore the after-noon is as long as the fore-noon: But it will not be ſo with thee; thou mayeſt have a long morning, and a ſhort noon, and a ſpeedy night. It may be long ere God does begin to ſtrive with thee; he may let thee live twenty, thirty, or forty years before he comes thus near thee; all this while is but as thy fore-noon; and then he may come near thy Conſcience, This is the noon of thy day, and here he may continue ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with thee for a year, a month, a week, a day, nay perhaps but one hour, as with <hi>Felix,</hi> with whom God ſtrugled but one hour in one Sermon: and if thou wilt not now hear, the night ſhall gather up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and thou ſhall be ſhut up under
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170260:115"/>darkneſs, God wil reſolve to ſtruggle but a little while, and he will not be ſo long in departing as he was in coming; but if noon be paſt, night comes ſuddenly; he may be long a coming, but quickly gone from thee.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Be more careful now becauſe God proportions the length of our day to the clearneſſe of the means which thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeſt, and to the ſtrength of thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions. If God give men lettle means, then he allows them the more time; if he gives them more means, he gives them the leſſe time for this great work. I do believe, that under the Law when things were dark, and in former days, when the Goſpel was but little preacht to what now it is, God did give men a longer and larger ſpace for Repentance then he does now, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10 he waited longer upon ſinners then now he does or will. And as he proportions to the means, ſo to our Convictions. If he do ſtrive much with a Soul and cauſe Convictions to fal thick and ſtrong upon it, it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he intends to contend but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while with that ſoul if he ſlight them. He will ſpeedly convert that Soul or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it. As we ſee in <hi>Felix,</hi> God did ſtrive
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170260:116"/>but a little while, but it was in a notable way, he made him tremble, but we do not find that he did ſtrive any more after that fit was over. We ſee ſomething of this in Nature, thoſe places and people who lye directly under the ſun, and have moſt of the heat and fervour of it, have not ſo long daies in ſummer as they who live more remote from in; as we in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have longer daies at Midſummer, then they that live under the Line; and they in <hi>Scotland</hi> have longer then we: So it is like to be with thee, if thy means be choice, and thy convictions ſtrong, thy nay is like to be ſhorter; have a care therefore that thou doſt not ſlight the one, or the other.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Be careful now, becauſe thou doſt not know whether ever God wil ſtrive any more with thee, if now thou ſlighteſt theſe, theſe may conclude thy day, and ſeal up thy condition; thou haſt no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner an intimation by theſe that thy day is begun but thou haſt a hint that it may be ending. The ſame word which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to open thine eyes, tels thee, that it is not long ere they may be ſhut again. God ſtands at thy heart and knocks, he promiſes thee, That if thou wilt open he wil come in, but he does not
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170260:116"/>promiſe thee to continue knocking; if thou wilt open ſaies he, I wil come in; if thou wilt not open, I wil be gone. I wil leave thee. Say not to the Word, Come again, for perhaps it wil never come ſo again; God wil not have thee deal ſo with thy neighbour, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.28. and doſt thou think he wil be dealt ſo withal? Is it not a great Mercy that he wil come once to thee? Is it not a baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thing for thee to think that the great God of Heaven and Earth ſhould waith upon ſuch a vile wretcht as thou art? Nay, is it not juſt that the Lord ſhould reſolve to offer thee life no more, and that be ſhould diſdainto follow thee any longer, who haſt refuſed him once, and again? therefore be careful, becauſe convictions ſlighted provoke the Lord to withdraw them, and once withdrawn it is a queſtion whether ever they wil come again.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Be careful now, becauſe if this day be loſt, all is loſt, it is ſuch a loſs as include in it all other loſſes; it is the loſſe of God, of happineſs and comfort of thy Soul, of eternal life, of that ſalvation which thou haſt perhaps hoped for.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170260:117"/>It is a loſs not to be ſupplied, becauſe when this is paſt, comes a night, and in it no man can work or walk This night is a very black night indeed, there is no light in it at all. God made a leſſer light to rule the night, as wel as a greater to rule the day; he did not leave the night wholly deſtitute; ſo that although the night be not a time to travel in, yet if a man be caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in his journey, he may find his way by the light of the moon, or ſtars; theſe do borrow a light of the ſun, and they do help in his abſence, and give notice that he is not wholly gone: But this night hath no light to rule it; darkneſs, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of darkneſs rules in it; There is no working in this night, becauſe no light; the word which is left behind gives no light to the foul when God hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn; he carries away all light with him, all true ſaving light; ſo that a man ſhal never ſee any thing aright. He leaves no light in providences, in Ordinances, in afflictions; they do not all of them bring a man to ſee God, or his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition aright: But all theſe things do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the Soul as thoſe falſe fires in the night, which do lead men out of their way. The word does but harden the heard, and blinde the eyes, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170260:117"/>men, and fil them with falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous hopes, which when they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake wil deceive them.

They have gotten ſo much of the knowledg of the truth to convince them that it is their duty to pray in the Family, and in the Cloſet; and conſcience minds them of this, and ſollicites them to go this way, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the day thus; but the affections they go after their covetouſneſs; the thoughts of his Calling comes in, ſome deſign for profit cals him off, and he goes away and ſlights conſcience; or the thought of his pleaſure comes to him, and he muſt attend that, ſo that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſons the truth under unrighteouſneſs; and although conſcience goes grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly up and down, and grumbles at him

                     <p>Such as theſe are mentioned in two Scriptures; the firſt is he that keeps it in a Negative unrighteouſneſs, or an unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of omiſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47. who dos not follow the truth in thoſe things which are clearly revealed to him, it is ſaid, <hi>that he ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, he who holds truth in a poſitive unrighteouſneſs, or an unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Commiſſion, who does not only refuſe to follow the light and truth into thoſe duties which it would lead him unto, but runs againſt the clear light and truth into the contrary practiſes, which the light and truth do abhor; Theſe are ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. Such men carry a conviction of the juſtice of that ſentence which God wil paſs upon thoſe who walk in ſuch wayes, and yet they both do them and delight in them; and if you obſerve how theſe men came to the height of wickedneſs, it was firſt

How many prayerleſs ſouls be here, that ſeldom or never ſeek the Lord in private? O if I ſhould run thorow particular known duties, how many ſhould we find guilty? and if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would ſtand, it would ſay,

It is every man and womans duty ſolemnly to ſearch the ſcripture, and to ſearch their hearts, and bring theſe two together, and then come to a ſerious reſolution, Is Chriſt in me or not of a truth?

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170260:122"/>of Chriſt, that they had eſcaped theſe pollutions, they fled from them as it were. But theſe intangled again, not with other ſins of another nature, as the people of God may be and are, who are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſecret inward corruptions, ſuch as the world takes no notice of, and as they were never ſenſible of before; as Spiritual pride in duties, &amp; vain thoughts <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are not intangled with theſe, but with the ſame ſins which they had eſcaped. And that is not all, for a child of God may be intangled in the ſame ſins again, that is for one act of ſin, or the like, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were. But he ſays, they are overcome, Satan prevails ſo far over them, that he carries them back to their former accuſtomed drunkenneſs and ſwearing, uncleanneſs, and the like. If once it be thus with them, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hopes of them, you may judge what the latter end of them wil be, it is worſe than the former. Thoſe men are ſo viſibly and ſuddenly changed by the ſtrength of bare convictions, and have not grace in the heart as wel as knowledge, are in a miſerable condition, becauſe they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hold it out long, and when they do fal back, it is a thouſand to one but they fal foulely; and when ſouls fal thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170260:122"/>their old ſins which they had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, it is a thouſand to one but they are held under them, and grow worſe and worſe to the end. We have a notable paſſage, <hi>Matthew</hi> 12.45. <hi>They enter in, and dwel there,</hi> they take up their reſt there. <hi>The uncleane Spirit went up and down ſeeking reſt, and could not find it;</hi> But now he enters, and hath what he was ſeeking for, as intimating in that he pitches here to take up his abode. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes in the diſtempers of the body are more dangerous then the firſt violence of the diſeaſe; and ſo are ſuch relapſes dangerous to the ſoul, for if thou art a relapſed drunkard, Swearer, Sabbath-breaker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou art in no more danger then thoſe who have alwaies been ſuch, and there is more hopes of recovering one who never had any conviction, nor pretended to any reformation, then of ſuch who have by the light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt eſcaped theſe, and are now returned again to their vomit, and wallowing in the mire.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 When men after a high profeſſion of Religion, and of giving up themſelves to Chriſt, fal back to worldly intereſts, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170260:123"/>mind and care for that, with neglect of the waies and people of God, whom they have cloſed withal before. Every one who hath made a profeſſion of Religion, and deſerts it, dos not fal into open prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and looſneſſe, it is poſſible they may retain ſo much of the light of Nature, and the word, as may reſtrain them from groſſe evils, and yet they may loſe all the heat and warmth which ſeemed to be in their affections to the things of God; ſo that although they wil not follow God and his people, yet they wil not tread in the footſteps of the prophane, but they ſtrike in with the civiler part of men, who do not openly oppoſe the ways of God, although neglect them, and they are for the world, and their care is how to be great, and rich; Religion muſt lie by to attend upon this; they are not ſuch who bring forth no fruit, but they bring forth nothing to perfection, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14. They pray ſometimes, and hear, but the cares and love of the world wil not let them do any thing wel and perfectly, it eats up the heart of every duty, and in the end choaks their profeſſion. As we ſee it is with the Corn, it grows up with the thorns, next the thorns overgrow that, and laſtly the thorns deſtroy it; So is it
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170260:123"/>with ſuch mens profeſſion. Firſt, it grows up with the World, and the love and cares of it; he prayes, and he hears, and he does many things which he did not do before; but all this does not cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him to the world, he loves that as formerly, and his heart goes out ſtrongly after it; yet his convictions being freſh and ſtrong, his profeſſion holds with the world. Afterwards as his convictions begin to grow weaker, and fainter, the World prevails, and he is leſs and leſs in the duties of Gods worſhip, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to plead excuſe for his remiſneſs, and ſlightneſs in the ſervice of God; he cannot ſpare ſo much time for prayer and hearing from his Calling; his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments are many, and therefore that cannot be expected from him which is from others. Now the world hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten above his profeſſion, and in a little time it choaks it, it dies away and comes to nothing. Thus it was with <hi>Judas,</hi> he had a covetous heart all the while he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt, but at laſt it got ground of him, and he was bought out of all for thirty pieces of ſilver; and thus <hi>Demas</hi> forſook the ſervice of the Lord in the Goſpel, when he met with an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of imbracing the preſent word. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:170260:124"/>4.10. How many be there in theſe days which have loſt and given up all their profeſſion of Chriſt this way, and have turned back only to mind the things of this preſent life? But ſuch ſouls who fal off with <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Daemas</hi> to the World, ſeldom return to Chriſt, the day of grace ſeems near at an end to ſuch as theſe. Take heed that there be not found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you ſuch as theſe are, who after the pretended giving up your ſelves to the Lord, do fal back to mind earthly things. <hi>Ph.</hi> 3.19. It is a ſad ſign that God intends to give ſuch their portion in this life.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 When men have ſinned away their Convictions, and conſcience grows qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; this muſt needs be a ſymptom of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining day, becauſe the more ſtupid and groſſe conſcience grows, the nearer men come to hardneſs of heart, and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scripture, <hi>a reprobate mind, Rom.</hi> 1.28. it is the very mark and brand of a Reprobate, of one who is ſet apart for ruine. There is a light in the heart of every natural man, which doth direct and counſel him, until ſuch time as it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, but if it be not followed it wil go out by degrees, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. But to this light the Lord gives in the light of the Word, and ſome help of the Spirit, and if
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170260:124"/>God do in judgement ſend a darkneſs upon the ſpirits of them who did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the firſt, what wil follow in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion upon them who quench this light, and put it out? that they may ſin with more quiet.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as light breaks in upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, eſpecially if it be from the workings of the Spirit, although in its common workings it makes conſcience to ſtir, and that makes a head as it were, againſt ſin, it wil not ſuffer the ſinner to go on quietly, and if Grace be not let down upon the wil, that labours to caſt out this unwelcome gueſt out of the ſoul, becauſe it cannot quietly enjoy its belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſin; and there is a great conteſt for a time betwixt light and corruption, the Conſcience and the Wil, who ſhal carry it; perhaps Conſcience while it is under freſh convictions ſeems reſolute, and wil not give him leave to commit any known ſin with quiet; but at laſt corruption pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails and carries it; yet not all at once; it gets a little liberty for ſuch a ſin which ſeems to be ſmal, and then for another, and ſo by degees Conſcience grows weak and feeble, and corruption ſtronger and ſtronger; and that is fulfilled, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. That becauſe they did not like
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170260:125"/>to retain God in their knowledg, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gives them up to reprobateneſſe of mind; they were weary of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God in their hearts when they had it, they could not ſwear, and be drunk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo quietly, becauſe of it, as they deſired, and therefore they deſired to be freed from the burthen of it, and now it is juſt with God to take it from them. And what does ſuch a diſpenſation of God ſpeak concerning ſuch a poor Creature? does it not ſay, Let ſin have his courſe? Does it not ſay, Let this man go on, and let none ſtop him until he come in hel? Theſe ſouls are in a ſad condition, being under the judgement which is written, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>The god of this world hath blinded their eyes.</hi> Thus it is with them who do not make much of Conſcience, but they ſlight it, and grieve it, until they harden it, &amp; when they have put out the eys of it, they go whither they wil, but they are not like to go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The conſcience is brawny, and hard by ſuch hard uſage, as ſome mens hands are which are uſed to hard labour; and certainly the ſins which are againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, do by degrees take away the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of it; and the more it is put to, the leſſe it feels, until it comes to be paſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170260:125"/>feeling, and then it is paſt hope. The nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Men and Women come to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; the nearer they are to ruine; the loſs of convictions is near the loſs of thy ſoul.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 When perſons after a profeſſion of Religion, and ſome trouble for ſin, take up ſuch principles as do ſtrengthen them in ſin, as too many in our daies have done. It is dangerous when men ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt light, but it is more dangerous when that which they cal light, by which they walk, leads them to ſin. It is ſad for men to be led aſide by the unrulineſs of their affections againſt conſcience, which would hold them back: but it is worſe when they have no more conſcience of ſin, and they have ſuckt in ſuch principles as keep conſcience quiet, whilſt they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil their luſts. The Devil is very cunning, and what he cannot doby troubling the ſoul with the ſight of ſin, and by preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the terrors of the Law, he effects by bringing a falſe unſound peace into it, which may ſtrengthen it in the way of ſin. The Devil would that men ſhould have no peace, or elſe a ſinful one; and therefore we have ſeen, that when ſome conſciences have been awakened, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil who hath had a great hand in their
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170260:126"/>troubles, hath laid a plaſter to them, which hath been far worſe than the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. As for example; ſome are troubled with the thoughts of the day of Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Judgment, now whereas they ought to have improved theſe troubles, to the getting of a ſhare in the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, he hath diſtilled this into them as a principle which they have greedily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, That the Reſurrection is paſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and theſe things of Reſurrection &amp; judgment, they are things only done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us. This is a ſhort way to ſhake off the ſad thoughts which did ariſe from the conſideration of ſuch a day, and theſe do exceedingly wel ſerve for Satans purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Some troubles ariſe from the want of communion with God in Ordinances, be cauſe the ſoul finds little ſweet in them, and it hears that Gods people have communion with God in theſe; Satan ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves this, and he preſently laies a plaſter, but it is a dangerous one; he tels them, That they may enjoy it above and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ordinances beſt of all, and this takes off their trouble by taking away the duty.</p>
                     <p>Some are troubled with the ſenſe of guilt which lies upon them, from the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of duties, and Satan hath a way ready to take off this alſo, by perſwading
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170260:126"/>them that they muſt not act until they are acted; for if God wil have them act he wil act them, and therefore it is not their fault if they do omit ſuch duties, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould not be troubled for it.</p>
                     <p>Some are troubled becauſe of ſin, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is opened for ſin paſt, and grows very fearful of ſin for time to come, and for a time perhaps they are troubled for this; but the Devil ſtudies their trouble, and he hath a plaiſter, which he applies, and it hath taken ſome poor deluded ſouls <hi>(viz.)</hi> there is nothing ſin but what a man thinks is Sin, and that there is no law but the ſpirit within a man, and that is to be his guide and his rule, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this man doth is no ſin, if it agree with his light; it is no matter whether it agree with the ſcripture, yea or no.</p>
                     <p>Some are troubled, becauſe they cannot tel whether the workings in their hearts be the workings of God, or ſome deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and workings of their own hearts; perhaps they have been under a ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſtry, who hath opened to them the counterfeit works of Hypocrites, and Conſcience hath been a little ſtartled at theſe things. Now to take off this, Satan perſwades them that God works all in man; yea good and evil,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170260:127"/>light and darkneſs is from God, and ſo there is no difference nor diſtinction, ſave to the Creatures apprehenſion. Theſe and many more ſuch devices hath Satan, to heal mens trouble of ſpirit, ſo that he may by it ſtrengthen their hands in ſin; and when they are come thus far, they are in a dangerous condition, for they ſeldom return again.</p>
                     <p>The Men and Women which are in ſuch a caſe, are like thoſe Lepers ſpoken of, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.44. <hi>The Priest ſhal pronounce him utterly unclean, the Leproſie is in his head.</hi> If Corruption have gotten into his Principles, ſuch a man is not onely unclean, but utterly ſo, and without all hopes of cleanſing; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for the Word to take hold of.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Chriſt intimates the ſame thing in that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.23. <hi>If the light in thee be darkneſs, how great is that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> It is the more dangerous becauſe it is in the place and ſtead of light, it is that which thou followeſt, and is to guide thee; therefore ſays Chriſt, in <hi>Luke</hi> 11.35. <hi>Take heed that the light in thee be not darkneſs.</hi> That man is ſad who wants light, but he is worſe who follows a falſe light; He that is ignorant of God, and his ways, and was never inlightned,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170260:127"/>is miſerable; but more miſerable is he who hath been inlightned, and hath now forſaken the light of the Lord, to follow the deluſions of Satan, and corrupt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples inſtead of light; it is a manifeſt ſign that Satan hath the leading of this man to perdition. Thus I have ſhewn you the ſad evidences of approaching night; remember I do not ſpeak poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and abſolutely of theſe things; I do not ſay, when I ſee men fall thus, and thus, that their day is paſt; but theſe are ſad ſymptoms that it is even at an end. When the Phyſitian ſees the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of death in the Patient, he looks on him as a dead man, according to the courſe of nature; but yet hath ſome hopes while there is life that he may recover, although he ſees no reaſon for it from the Patient: He hath perhaps ſeen ſome recovered in an unuſual way, and when they have been paſt hopes. So it may be in this caſe, although men have theſe ſpots and tokens upon them, yet we dare not be poſitive. God does go ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in unuſual ways, and beyond the common experiences of his people, but we have little reaſon to expect ſuch things in his diſpenſations. God may let men go ſo far, and fal ſo fouly, that al his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170260:128"/>may beſtartled at it, and conclude him a veſſel of wrath, and yet when ſuch a ſoul is gone to the very borders of hell, and there is nothing expected but his dropping in; then may the Lord ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; Chriſt may come at the very Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and it may be the darkeſt time of all, before the breaking of the day. But this is not Gods uſual way, ſo that we cannot ſay to this man, or to that. Thy day is over; yet we may have ſuch grounds and footings for our fears of ſome men, as may ſeldom deceive us. <hi>I</hi> cannot ſay, that the day of Grace is paſt to any one of you in particular, yet I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is paſt to many here; and I doubt my fears concerning ſome oppoſing har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened ſinners, and ſome Apoſtate profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors wil appear at laſt to have too much footing. I could wiſh that the day of Grace were like to be as long to you, as you think it to be, but I am ſure out of what hath been ſpoken from ſcripture, it is plain, That it is a hidden, uncertain, and oftentimes a ſhort day; and therefore what I ſay to one, I ſay to all, <hi>Harden not your hearts while it is called to day;</hi> and more eſp cially you, who by all ſigns and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens ſeems to be near unto darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>But ſome poor ſouls may ſay upon the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170260:128"/>hearing of theſe things, I fear my day is paſt, I have had Convictions under the Word, and I have made ſtrong reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but I have not anſwered them, I fear I have loſt my day, when I loſt theſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Art thou convinced of thy loſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate now, and of thy need of Chriſt? Are former convictions revived, do they come to thy remembrance afreſh, and do they make freſh and ful impreſſions upon thy heart, ſo that thou doeſt now walk under the weight and burden of ſin? O if God does open conſcience afreſh, and ſet it a bleeding under Old and new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, it is a ſign he hath not ſhut up the day; it is a ſign he hath not drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Spirit from the Word; but he hath ſet an edge upon it, and it is like a two-edged ſword, it cuts on every ſide, it enters deeper into the ſoul than ever it did; this is a great argument that the day is not over, when there is more light put into the Word for thy ſoul then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. Again, it is a ſign that he hath not done with thee, becauſe he puts in more light and tenderneſſe into thy Conſcience; if he had wholly leſt thee, he would have leſt the Word, and Conſcience, and have ſtruck the one dumb, and the other blind, or deaf,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170260:129"/>and have put thee in a condition paſt feeling, yet let me tell thee, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe ſtirrings of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thou maieſt periſh; for theſe are not things to be reſted upon; God follows many men with convictions whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver converts. There muſt be more than thy Convictions to ſhew for Heaven, for theſe are poor things alone, and do ſpeak thus much (which is to my purpoſe) that thou haſt now an opportunity in thy hand, and there is hope concerning thee, becauſe God is yet treating with thy Soul about the great affairs of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Art thou convinced of the evil of not liſtning to former Convictions? Doeſt thou ſee, and art ſenſible how great an evil it is to loſe them? Doeſt thou ſee into what danger thou didſt run thy ſoul, by ſlighting the firſt offers which the Lord made thee? and how miſerable thou hadſt been if he had taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt thee, to have gone away, and to have returned no more with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of thy loſt miſerable eſtate; thou mighteſt have been now in Hell. And whereas thou art now awakened by the word, thou mightſt not have been awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned until thou hadſt awaked there; Art
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170260:129"/>thou ſenſible of theſe things, and art thou now able to juſtifie the Lord, if he had denied thee the leaſt beam of light for thy Soul here? and canſt thou now bleſs the Lord for affording thee a freſh ſight and ſenſe of thy condition? this is a ſign thy day is not over; for ſuch kind of workings as theſe are found in the hearts of the people of the Lord, when they have their Conſciences opened afreſh, after ſuch ſlumbers wherein they had loſt the ſight and ſenſe of their own conditions; ordinarily ſuch Souls ſmart for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of former convictions, and are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for not following them. And they are lain down before God in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his mercy, in not taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt them for thoſe things; and they are much in bleſſing him; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming near them again in his Word, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not in a way of comfort; they bleſs him for convincing and awakening light; canſt thou do thus? then thy day is not yet paſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Does thy former loſs of convictions make thee more willing now to come in to Chriſt, and to cloſe fully with him in al things, and to labour after a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of the time to better advantage? does former careleſneſs lay engagements
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170260:130"/>upon thy heart to future watchfulneſs? do you ſay as the Apoſtle does. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. The time paſt may ſuffice to have been careleſs and negligent of my own ſoul, and diſobedient to the Goſpel, and to the checks of Conſcience; as for that which remains, it is little enough for the great work of ſerving the Lord, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my Calling and Election ſure. Now enquire, Do thy preſent convictions work thus? do they put thee upon more cloſe and conſtant purſuance of God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on endeavouring to walk cloſe with him, and to redeem time for him? this carries yet more light of evidence with it that thy day is not over.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Doſt thou find a difference betwixt theſe convictions, and thoſe which thou hadſt formerly? That there is more of the ſtirring of the wil and affections in theſe than were in them. There is a great difference betwixt the ſtirring of the conſcience, and the ſtirring of the Wil, Conſcience may be awakened, and that may move a man ſtrongly after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and the wil and affections may move him after his luſts all the while; and where conſcience is awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Wil not changed, there the Devil may ſteal theſe troubles away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170260:130"/>falſe grounds, he hath many waies to quiet ſuch mens conſciences; but if the Wil be moved truly toward God, there is no way to quiet that, but by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiment of its end, which is, the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. Therefore the main thing by which we ſhould judge of the work, and ſo of the day of Grace is this; by labouring to enform our ſelves aright, what difference there is betwixt theſe and former convictions, and whether theſe be better than they or no, which did die away, and whether there be more of the wil and affections in theſe than in thoſe we formerly had, for every work is ſo much the better as it hath more of Wil in it, which is indeed the ſeat of Grace.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>How ſhall I know whether my stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings are of my Conſcience, or my Will?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> I might give you many things, but <hi>I</hi> touch it now but occaſionallie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhal confine my ſelf to theſe three ſhort directions: Obſerve thy

                           <item>2 D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt obſerve thy Troubles, whether they be moſt for the ſenſe of ſin, or the apprehenſions of wrath; if conſcience be
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170260:131"/>only awakened, that eyes only the wrath to come, and thinks of nothing elſe but of eſcaping, and it takes not ſin into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, but as it is forced by the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry connexion betwixt that and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but if the wil and affections be wrought over in this trouble, then the greateſt trouble is becauſe of the evil of ſin, as it diſhonours God, and as it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Soul from communion with <hi>God,</hi> and the ſoul is troubled at the preſence of that, and ſtudies how it may be rid of that. Sin is a heavy burthen to a ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wil, but wrath is the only burden to an intangled, but not renewed conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Obſerve thy Deſires, What do they run out moſt after. Chriſt or Comfort, Peace or Purity? if the trouble be onely a forced trouble from conſcience, then the Soul dos ordinarily look no farther then the preſent trouble, and how to be rid of that; it is peace that conſcience looks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but if the Wil be moved, that muſt have ſomething elſe beſides Peace, it is not a calm wilſerve the turn, it muſt have Chriſt, and communion with him, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wil ſatisfie.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Look to thy endeavours, when are they ſtrongeſt and moſt vigorous, and drawn out moſt after heaven and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170260:131"/>things? in thy troubles, or in thy calms? I have obſerved ſome, that when they have been under trouble, and terrours of Conſcience, they would then be very ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſeem to take much pain for Heaven; but when Conſcience is a little quieted, they lay aſide their Religion, and there is no more noiſe of it; this is a ſign that their ſtirrings were barely from Conſcience. But other Souls, whoſe wils were wrought upon as wel as their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, have been more active and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the ways of God, as they have gotten more peace and aſſurance of Gods love; and there is a clear reaſon for ſuch different effects from their quiet; becauſe quiet and peace was the thing which the inflamed Conſcience ſought for, but the ſanctified will and affections ſought for another thing; and although a little Peace may ſatisfie Conſcience, and take off the edge of it, this will ſet an edge upon the affections; that which calms Conſcience, quickens the ſanctified Wil; for every reliſh that it hath of grace or peace makes it ſeek for more. Try your ſelves by theſe things, and if you find that your Convictions are accompanied with the ſtirrings of the wil and affections, be of good hope, for thy day of grace is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170260:132"/>if thou haſt a will for God, if he ſtrive, and you grow more tender and ſenſible, fear not to follow thy convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to lay hold of the Promiſes which ſuit with thy condition. Let for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer convictions neglected humble thee, but let them not diſcourage thee.</p>
                     <p>But withal take this word of advice, and ſo I ſhal conclude.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Take heed of thy Heart, leſt it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee; thou haſt had ſuch ſtirrings which did look like a work of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but they have died away; be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of theſe, leſt they ſhould do ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Thou knoweſt how ſubject the heart is to grow cold, and to ſhift and put off Convictions, and when it is under them how ſeemingly willing it is to convert, and return to God; how ready to make promiſes and vows to God, and how ready to forſake all theſe again; it hath cheated thee once already, therefore watch it as a deceitful thing, the way not to be deceived, is to expect it, or at leaſt fear it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Reſolve to take the more pains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt loſt ſo many precious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, knowing, that if thou art not nearer to happineſs and eternal life then other men, thou art farther off, and thou
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170260:132"/>hadſt need labour to redeem what thou haſt loſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Beleeve not Satan, who ſays thy day is over, for he knows it not, <hi>and he is a Lyar from the beginning.</hi> There is abundantly more hope of thee who lieſt under ſuch fears, than there is of one who lies and lives in ſin, and ſays his day is not yet paſt. Satan ordinarily tels men, that the day is paſt, when it does begin to ſhine upon them, and he tels them who are in darkneſs, and in the night, that it is day, and it is time enough for them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Prize thy Convictions highly, and look upon it as a great Mercy, that God wil at laſt look upon thee a poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, an old ſinner, an old ſlighter of convictions, an old back-ſlider. O what a mercy is it to thee that that dreadful paſſage is not made good upon thy ſoul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14. <hi>The back ſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own wayes.</hi> God might have ſaid to thee, when thou didſt caſt off Convictions at firſt, and when thou didſt back-ſlide from the reformation which thou didſt begin. Be filled with back-ſlidings, thou ſhalt have thy bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ful of them, thou ſhalt never have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more help to return. O what a mercy
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170260:133"/>is it, that after all this he ſhould begin to recover thee, and ſet thee a freſh about the work of returning to Chriſt?</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Be much in bleſſing God for what he hath done, that he hath vouchſafed again to viſit thy Soul from on high, and to ſtir up thee again, when perhaps many that are in Hell were in thy caſe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; God hath taken advantage againſt them for ſlighting the Word, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and he might have done ſo with thee, if he would have dealt exactly with thee. Who is it that maketh thee to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? Is it not the Lord? <hi>To him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be given all honour, and glory, and praiſe.</hi>
